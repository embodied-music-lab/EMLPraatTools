# The barrel eml-lib-stats.praat will NOT work in place of this

# THE OBJECT
# Recorded against: vt -- 60 rows, 2 columns.
# The objects this workflow ran on are named in the block below.
# None of them is built or opened by a step below: see
# PRECONDITION, and open them before you run this script.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# ============================================================
# PRECONDITION -- THIS SCRIPT CANNOT REBUILD ITS DATA
#
# These objects were already open when this recording started.
#     Table vt
#     Spectrum tok
# Nothing in the session made them, so nothing below can remake them.
#
# YOU MUST SUPPLY THE DATA YOURSELF, open and named as above, before you
# run this file. The steps below select by name: with nothing of that name
# open the script stops at its first step, and with DIFFERENT data of that
# name it runs to the end and answers a different question without saying so.
# ============================================================

# Name your data objects and columns here for this recorded
# workflow. Edit a name to run the same workflow on other data;
# nothing below this block names an object, a column or an axis
# range or a figure format.
