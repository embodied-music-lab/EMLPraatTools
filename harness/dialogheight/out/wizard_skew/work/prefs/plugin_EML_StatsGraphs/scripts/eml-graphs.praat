# EML Graphs — Main Script (Entry Point)

# EML Graphs Plugin
# License: GPL-3.0-or-later
# Version: 3.0
# Date: 4 April 2026
#
# Purpose: Entry point for the standalone EML Graphs tool. All logic lives
#          in eml-graphs-form.praat (workflow, forms, config, context) and
#          the draw-layer files (eml-graph-procedures.praat,
#          eml-draw-procedures.praat, eml-annotation-procedures.praat).
#
# This file is the standalone entry point only. Stats wrappers and the
# wizard call @emlGraphsWorkflow directly via their own includes.
