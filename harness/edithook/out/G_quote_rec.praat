# THE EML LIBRARY
# Recorded under Praat 6.6.30. Paths are home-relative, so they work
# for any user on this platform. If this file fails to parse, the
# plugin is somewhere else -- edit this block and nothing else.

# A version guard cannot help here: `include` is refused inside an
# if-block, so the file cannot choose its own path at run time.
# The barrel eml-lib-stats.praat will NOT work in place of this
# list: its own relative includes resolve against THIS file's
# folder, not its own.

# THE OBJECT
# Recorded against: Table demo -- 3 rows, 2 columns.
# The objects this workflow ran on are named in the block below.
# None of them is built or opened by a step below: see
# PRECONDITION, and open them before you run this script.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# ============================================================
# PRECONDITION -- THIS SCRIPT CANNOT REBUILD ITS DATA
#
# Table demo was already open when this recording started.
# Nothing in the session made it, so nothing below can remake it.
#
# YOU MUST SUPPLY THE DATA YOURSELF, open and named as above, before you
# run this file. The steps below select by name: with nothing of that name
# open the script stops at its first step, and with DIFFERENT data of that
# name it runs to the end and answers a different question without saying so.
# ============================================================

# Name your data objects and columns here for this recorded
# workflow. Edit a name to run the same workflow on other data;
# nothing below this block names an object, a column or an axis
# range or a figure format.
data1$ = "Table demo"   ; run 1, step 1 (edit)

# --- Step 1 (edit) ---
selectObject: data1$
data = selected ()
# Changed f0 in row 1 from 101 to he said "hi"
# This step changes the table in memory.
# Nothing here writes back to the file the table came from.

Set string value: 1, "f0", "he said ""hi"""

# The same step through the menu:
# In the GUI: select the Table, open EML's Table editor and make
# the change there. An edit typed into Praat's own table
# window is not captured by this recorder.
