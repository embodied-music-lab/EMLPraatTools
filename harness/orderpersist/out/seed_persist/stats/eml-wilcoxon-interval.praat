# WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHY IT IS STANDALONE.
#
# Tracker item (mailbox/to-opus/TRACKER_KIT_AND_1p0.md, A.5): "Wilcoxon H-L
# interval, approx branch = port of R's corrected-z inversion (intervals
# item 3.8 ...) — UNMEASURED." Item 3.8, per
# docs/WORK_ORDER_INTERVALS_2026-08-26.md, names
# @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample in stats/eml-inferential.praat.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING (per standing instruction): @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample
# and @emlHodgesLehmannPaired already exist in stats/eml-inferential.praat and
# their "normal approximation" branches already invert R's continuity-corrected
# z statistic by the same route this file uses -- Brent's zeroin ported from
# R's own src/library/stats/src/zeroin.c. Run directly against R 4.3.3 on two
# forced-approximation fixtures (n1=55,n2=60 two-sample; n=55 paired), the
# existing code's .low/.high agreed with wilcox.test(conf.int = TRUE)$conf.int
# to full double precision (differences at the 1e-13 relative level, i.e.
# floating-point noise, not a defect). The command and output are in this
# repository's commit message / agent report for this file's construction,
# and are reproduced in validate/v158_wilcoxon_interval.R's own R session so
# the claim is re-runnable there, not merely asserted here.
#
# ONE GENUINE GAP WAS FOUND, on the PAIRED (one-sample) form only. R's
# one-sample approximation branch widens alpha in a loop when the requested
# level cannot be bracketed by the sample (see "THE ALGORITHM" below), and on
# success at a wider alpha it emits `warning("requested conf.level not
# achievable")` and reports the ACHIEVED level, not the requested one. The
# existing @emlHodgesLehmannPaired ports the widening loop and returns the
# correct bounds, but has no `.warning$` output at all to carry that signal,
# and does not report the achieved level either -- silently correct on the
# numbers, silently short of telling a caller the requested level was not
# met. Measured (n = 3 paired, x = {-0.626, 0.184, -0.836}, y = {-0.446, 0.3,
# -0.777}, requested level 0.999, R's approximation branch forced with
# exact = FALSE): R widens alpha from 0.001 to where it achieves conf.level =
# 0.488 and warns; a caller of this file's own procedure at forced
# approximation gets `.warning$` and `.achievedLevel` naming exactly that.
# (At n = 3 the WIRED @emlHodgesLehmannPaired takes R's own exact branch
# instead, per its own n<50 gate, so this gap is invisible there and only
# reachable by a caller that deliberately asks for the approximation branch
# — which is what a standalone approximation-branch procedure is for.)
# validate/v158_wilcoxon_interval.R re-derives both of the numbers above.
#
# THE ESTIMATE IS NOT THIS FILE'S SUBJECT. There is a separately documented,
# SETTLED difference between R's own $estimate on the approximation branch
# (a root of W with the continuity correction switched off) and the plugin's
# estimate (the median of the cross-differences / Walsh averages on every
# branch, per Fable's 26 August work order). That gap is ruled to stay as
# documentation of R's own behaviour -- see validate/v145_hodges_lehmann_
# interval.R's header. This file reports the same estimate
# (median-of-differences) as @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample / Paired already do,
# for the same reason, and does not reopen that question.
#
# THIS FILE IS DELIBERATELY UNWIRED. Per this task's brief: "Do NOT wire
# this into any existing file. Connecting it up is a later step and those
# files belong to other people right now." stats/eml-inferential.praat is
# mid-flux under the tracker's own pending "uniform outcome contract"
# item (A.5), so nothing here is added to it, and nothing here is called
# from it. This file depends only on @emlRankVector
# (stats/eml-core-utilities.praat), a stable low-level utility, and is
# otherwise self-contained: its own copy of R's W(d) for both the
# two-sample and one-sample forms, and its own copy of Brent's zeroin. Its
# procedure and internal-helper names (`eml_wci*`, `emlWilcoxonIntervalApprox`)
# are deliberately distinct from eml-inferential.praat's `eml_hl*` /
# `emlHodgesLehmann*` names so the two files can be included together later
# without a silent redefinition.
#
# THE OUTCOME CONTRACT. This file uses `.ok` / `.error$` / `.warning$`, the
# tracker's accepted-but-not-yet-applied uniform contract (A.5), rather than
# the `.error$`-only shape @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample / Paired currently use
# -- read from stats/eml-anova-kernel.praat's `.ok = 0` / `.error$ = ""` /
# `.warning$ = ""` initialisation and `.ok = 1` on success, which is the
# shape this file matches.

# ORIGIN NOTICE -- required by mailbox/to-opus/RULING_PORT_ATTRIBUTION_2026-09-01.md.
# This file translates two pieces of R's own implementation, not merely an
# implementation of a published method.
#
# 1. SOURCE.
#
#    a. R's asymptotic Wilcoxon/Hodges-Lehmann confidence-interval algorithm
#       (the W(d) statistics, the two-sample root() with its endpoint
#       returns, and the one-sample root() with its alpha-widening loop):
#       translated from src/library/stats/R/wilcox.test.R, function
#       wilcox.test.default, the "conf.int" blocks. Fetched 2 September 2026
#       from
#       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wch/r-source/561d2158da5ce11153d3595de865de840339c59a/src/library/stats/R/wilcox.test.R
#       -- commit 561d215..., the tip of the r-source mirror's
#       refs/heads/tags/R-4-3-3 ref, i.e. R 4.3.3 itself (measured: 488
#       lines at that commit, versus 1136 at the mirror's trunk tip, which
#       carries R-devel changes past 4.3.3 not present in the installed
#       oracle). Cross-checked against the installed R 4.3.3's own
#       formals(stats:::wilcox.test.default) -- digits.rank = Inf there,
#       matching this fetched file and NOT the trunk copy's digits.rank = 7L
#       -- so the fetched version is confirmed to be the version actually
#       running as this kit's oracle, not merely a same-numbered tag.
#
#    b. Brent's zeroin, the root finder wilcox.test's uniroot() calls:
#       translated from src/library/stats/src/zeroin.c, function
#       R_zeroin2, fetched the same day from
#       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wch/r-source/561d2158da5ce11153d3595de865de840339c59a/src/library/stats/src/zeroin.c

#
# 4. WHAT CHANGED IN TRANSLATION.
#
#    Language: R / C to Praat script, throughout.
#
#    Algorithm: NONE. Every constant and every comparison in the ported
#    procedures below is R's own -- the sign(dz)*0.5 / sign(zd)*0.5
#    continuity correction, the tie-corrected SIGMA.CI formulas (recomputed
#    at the shifted data on every call, never hoisted), the two-sample
#    root()'s early-return endpoints, the one-sample root()'s repeat-loop
#    alpha doubling and its `alpha >= 2` termination test, and Brent's
#    zeroin iterate-for-iterate (the swap, the linear-vs-quadratic-inverse
#    branch, the 0.75*cb*q acceptance test, the tol_act floor). DBL_EPSILON
#    is written as the literal 2.220446049250313e-16, which Praat has no
#    name for.
#
#    Structural changes forced by Praat, not by the algorithm: R's W(d) and
#    wdiff() are closures captured over x, y, correct; Praat has no
#    closures, so W(d) is a procedure taking the vectors and d explicitly,
#    and `.correct` is always passed as 1 (this file's callers never need
#    R's `correct = FALSE` re-evaluation path, which R uses only to compute
#    its OWN point estimate -- a quantity this file does not report; see
#    "THE ESTIMATE IS NOT THIS FILE'S SUBJECT" above). R's uniroot() takes a
#    function pointer; Brent's zeroin here takes a `.form` switch (1: the
#    two-sample W; 2: the one-sample/paired W) and calls the matching
#    procedure at the one site R's zeroin.c calls `(*f)(b, info)`, because
#    Praat has no function values to pass instead.
#
#    Precision-relevant decision carried over unchanged: R re-strips zero
#    differences created BY THE SHIFT inside the one-sample W(d) itself
#    (`xd <- xd[xd != 0]`, evaluated fresh at every d, including at d =
#    mumin and d = mumax, both of which ARE sample points and therefore
#    always drop exactly one entry there) -- not merely the zero
#    differences present in the original, unshifted sample. This file's
#    @eml_wciWPaired reproduces that re-stripping at every call, which is
#    why its bounds match R's to double precision at exactly the endpoints
#    where a naive port (stripping zeroes once, up front, and never again)
#    would silently disagree.

# @emlWilcoxonIntervalApprox
# ============================================================================
# The Wilcoxon / Hodges-Lehmann confidence interval, APPROXIMATION BRANCH
# ONLY: R's continuity-corrected z inversion, ported, for both the
# two-sample (independent groups) and paired (matched-pairs / one-sample)
# forms of wilcox.test. This procedure does NOT decide exact vs.
# approximation -- that branch gate (n < 50 and no ties) belongs to whatever
# orchestrates the choice; a caller that wants the exact branch calls
# something else. This is deliberate and matches the task's scope: the
# tracker's UNMEASURED item names the approximation branch, and the exact
# branch is a different, already-existing piece of machinery (the U- and
# T+-null-distribution DPs) that this file does not duplicate.
#
# THE ESTIMATE reported is the median of the cross-differences (two-sample)
# or Walsh averages (paired) -- the SAME quantity
# @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample / Paired report on every branch, per Fable's
# work order. It is not R's own approximation-branch $estimate (a root of W
# with the continuity correction switched off); see the file header.
#
# Arguments:
#   .v1#, .v2# - two-sample: independent groups, any sizes >= 1.
#                paired: matched pairs, EQUAL length; R's x - y is formed
#                internally.
#   .paired    - 0 for the two-sample form, 1 for the paired form.
#   .level     - confidence level as a proportion (e.g. 0.95).
#
# Output:
#   .estimate     - median of cross-differences (two-sample) or Walsh
#                   averages (paired); undefined only when it cannot be
#                   formed at all (paired: never, since even all-zero
#                   differences have a median; two-sample: never, for
#                   n1, n2 >= 1)
#   .low, .high   - confidence bounds, or undefined on refusal
#   .achievedLevel - the confidence level actually achieved. Equals .level
#                    except on the paired form when the requested level
#                    could not be bracketed and alpha was widened -- see
#                    .warning$. R: `conf.level <- 1 - pmin(1, alpha)`.
#   .ok           - 1 if .low/.high were produced, 0 on refusal
#   .error$       - refusal reason, or "" when .ok = 1
#   .warning$     - non-fatal caveat, or "" when none applies. The only
#                   case this file raises is the paired form's "requested
#                   confidence level not achievable" (R's own warning text,
#                   with the achieved level named)
