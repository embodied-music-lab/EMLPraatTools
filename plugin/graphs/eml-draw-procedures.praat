#
# Procedures: 15 of them. THE COUNTING RULE, so this number can be checked
# rather than believed:
#     grep -c "^procedure emlDraw" plugin/graphs/eml-draw-procedures.praat
# A drawing procedure is defined at column 1 and named emlDraw*; every one of
# them is a whole-figure entry point, and this file holds no emlDraw* helpers
# (the primitives — @emlDrawViolin, @emlDrawBox, @emlDrawMarker, @emlDrawAxes
# and the rest — live in eml-graph-procedures.praat and are NOT counted here).
# The 15 split three ways by what they consume:
#   * 10 take a Table object id plus column names (@emlDrawTimeSeries through
#     @emlDrawGroupedBoxPlot below). These are exactly the ten that disclose:
#     grep -c "^    @emlDiscloseBegin:" on this file returns 10. The leading
#     four-space indent is what makes that a count of CALL SITES rather than
#     of mentions: every mention in a comment block begins with "#", or with
#     spaces then "#", so none of them matches. (The bare pattern without the
#     indent does NOT return 10, and the figure it does return moves whenever
#     one of these comments is reworded — do not quote it here.)
#   * 4 take another Praat object — Pitch, Sound, Spectrum, Ltas.
#   * 1, @emlDrawLMMForest, takes no argument at all and reads emlLMM.* /
#     emlWaldCI.* globals.
# Fourteen of the 15 are reached from the DISPATCH (DRAW) block of
# eml-graphs-form.praat; @emlDrawLMMForest is called by eml-lmm.praat.
#
# The 15, in the order they are defined below:
#   @emlDrawF0Contour       — F0 contour from Pitch object
#   @emlDrawWaveform        — waveform from Sound object
#   @emlDrawSpectrum        — spectrum from Spectrum object
#   @emlDrawLTAS            — long-term average spectrum
#   @emlDrawTimeSeries      — time series (modes A + D)
#   @emlDrawTimeSeriesCI    — time series with confidence interval
#   @emlDrawSpaghettiPlot   — individual subject traces (categorical x)
#   @emlDrawBarChart        — grouped bar chart with error bars
#   @emlDrawViolinPlot      — violin plot
#   @emlDrawScatterPlot     — scatter plot with regression
#   @emlDrawBoxPlot         — box plot (Tukey whiskers)
#   @emlDrawHistogram       — histogram (overlap or faceted)
#   @emlDrawGroupedViolin   — two-factor violin (category × sub-group)
#   @emlDrawGroupedBoxPlot  — two-factor box plot
#   @emlDrawLMMForest       — LMM fixed-effect coefficient forest plot
#                             (no arguments; not on the graphs-form dispatch)
#
# Disclosure helpers (v1.21):
#   @emlDiscloseBegin       — open a disclosure batch for one figure
#   @emlDisclose            — one disclosure, routed to its channels
#   @emlDiscloseEnd         — render the batch into the annotation block
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# FIGURE DISCLOSURE — @emlDiscloseBegin / @emlDisclose / @emlDiscloseEnd
# ============================================================================
# THE RULE: "draw the image as the image
# unless someone asks to annotate." Three channels, one rule each.
#
#   Info window   ALWAYS. Every disclosure goes here unconditionally, whatever
#                 the caller is and whatever the user ticked. The Info window
#                 is where a reader goes to find out what a figure did, and it
#                 costs the figure nothing.
#
#   The figure    ONLY when the user ticked Annotate. Rendered through the
#                 EXISTING annotation block — annotBlockN / annotBlockLabel$[]
#                 / annotBlockDraw$[], drawn by @emlDrawAnnotationBlock into a
#                 corner chosen by @emlPlaceElements. No new text slot and no
#                 new class of on-figure element were invented for this.
#
#   emlSubtitle$  NEVER. It is the USER'S field: the graphs form asks for it
#                 ("Subtitle") and persists it to config. @emlDrawTimeSeries
#                 and @emlDrawBarChart must not append a machine caption to
#                 it after " | ": saving and restoring the global would keep
#                 the global intact while the DRAWN figure carried the user's
#                 own words with a tail bolted on that the user never wrote
#                 and could not remove, whether or not Annotate was ticked.
#                 Nothing in this file writes to emlSubtitle$.
#
# WHY THE GATE LIVES HERE AND NOT IN @emlDrawAnnotationBlock
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The block is NOT already gated on `annotate`. Verified by drawing a scatter
# plot with annotate = 0 and scatterShowFormula = 1: the OLS formula box
# renders. @emlDrawScatterPlot's two call sites under the comment
# "Formula on graph if requested (independent of annotate)" populate the block
# from scatterShowFormula alone, and the render site is guarded only by
# `if annotBlockN > 0`. So a non-empty block does not mean the user asked for
# annotations, and the rule has to be enforced at the point where a line is
# ADDED. That is what @emlDisclose does. The pre-existing formula and
# correlation lines keep their own behaviour; only disclosures are gated.
#
# `annotate` is a graphs-form global. Standalone callers — the stats wrappers,
# the LMM tool, harness/stress_cases — never set it, so it is read through
# variableExists: undefined means "the user ticked nothing", which is the safe
# reading of a rule whose default is a clean figure.
#
# LINE BUDGET
# -----------
# @emlDisclose stops adding at 20 entries. The Info window is never capped.
#
# 20 is a budget on what one figure may TRY to say. It is not a ceiling on
# annotBlockN and it is not a promise about the box:
#   * Other code writes into the block directly. @emlDrawScatterPlot's stats
#     lines and eml-graphs-form.praat's POST-DISPATCH omnibus line both append
#     to annotBlockN without going through @emlDisclose, so neither is counted
#     against the 20.
#   * @emlDrawAnnotationBlock WRAPS each entry to a
#     share of the plotting frame, so the number of rows RENDERED is larger
#     again — one long entry can render as four. Height, not width, is now
#     what a wordy disclosure costs. See the contract on @emlDisclose below.
# The glossary entry for annotBlockN in eml-annotation-procedures.praat is the
# other half of this. @emlDrawAnnotationBlock's own contract does not document
# the 20 — it points back here.
#
# USAGE inside a draw procedure:
#     @emlDiscloseBegin: "Bar chart"
#     ... draw the data ...
#     @emlDisclose: "3 row(s) skipped (missing or non-numeric value).", ""
#     @emlDiscloseEnd: xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax, qTL, qTR, qBL, qBR, legendCorner$
#
# .legendCorner$ is the corner this figure's legend went to, or "" if it drew
# none. The disclosure box must not land there, and it must not land on the
# graphs form's own omnibus box either — see @emlDiscloseEnd.
#
# @emlDrawScatterPlot is the one exception: it already owns an annotation
# block and already renders it, so it calls @emlDiscloseBegin/@emlDisclose and
# lets its own existing render site carry the lines. It does not call
# @emlDiscloseEnd — doing so would draw a second box.
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlDiscloseBegin: .chart$
# Opens a disclosure batch. .chart$ is the figure's name in prose; it prefixes
# every Info-window line so a transcript with several figures in it says which
# figure each note came from.
#
# Outputs (globals, deliberately — @emlDisclose and @emlDiscloseEnd are
# separate procedures and Praat has no other way to share state between them):
#   emlDiscloseChart$    — the name passed in
#   emlDiscloseBase      — annotBlockN on entry, restored by @emlDiscloseEnd
#   emlDiscloseOnFigure  — 1 if the user ticked Annotate, else 0
#   emlDiscloseInfoN     — lines sent to the Info window this figure
#   emlDiscloseFigN      — lines placed on the figure this figure
#   emlDiscloseFigLabel$[1..emlDiscloseFigN] — their text
#
# The last three are the disclosure LEDGER. The Info channel is observable
# from the transcript; the figure channel is not, short of decoding a PNG, so
# the ledger is how a caller — or validate/v29_figure_disclosure.R — finds out
# what actually reached the figure. It survives @emlDiscloseEnd, which hands
# annotBlockN back to its entry value.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlDisclose: .short$, .advice$
# One disclosure.
#   .short$   the fact. Goes to BOTH channels, so it has to fit in a corner
#             box.
#
#             WHAT THE BOX GUARANTEES.
#             @emlDrawAnnotationBlock WRAPS. Every entry is broken through
#             @emlWrapText against a budget taken from the PLOTTING FRAME —
#             emlAnnotBlockWidthShare, default 0.55 of the inner viewport,
#             less the box's own padding and its corner inset — so however
#             long .short$ is, the box does not reach across the panel or off
#             the canvas. A height guard re-wraps wider, to at most 0.72,
#             and only when the box would otherwise stand taller than
#             emlAnnotBlockHeightShare (default 0.95) of the frame. Both
#             globals are read through variableExists, so a caller that wants
#             a narrower or a taller box may set either before it draws.
#
#             WHAT IT COSTS INSTEAD IS HEIGHT. The 20 above is 20 CALLER
#             ENTRIES, not 20 drawn rows: a long .short$ spends one of the 20
#             and can render as four rows. So shorter is still better — not
#             because a long line overhangs any more, but because a corner box
#             half the frame wide and a third of it tall covers the data it is
#             about. @emlDrawScatterPlot's formula line, at 39 characters, is
#             the calibration for a line that reads as a caption.
#
#             THERE IS NO CHARACTER RULE, AND ONE WOULD NOT BE A GUARANTEE.
#             "Keep .short$ under about 50 characters" cannot bound the box:
#             annotSize scales WITH the viewport, so a character is very
#             nearly a fixed FRACTION of the panel at every figure size, and a
#             fraction is not what a character count controls. Measured at
#             annotSize, a 48-character line takes 0.68 of the inner width at
#             6 x 4 inches and 0.88 at 3.6 x 3 — inside that rule, over half
#             the panel at both sizes. The observation behind it is still a
#             real defect and is the one the wrap fixes: 7 Aug 2026, a
#             71-character mean note on a 6-inch time series, placed in the
#             correct corner, with the rising line running underneath it.
#             The full measurement table is in @emlDrawAnnotationBlock's own
#             header in eml-annotation-procedures.praat.
#   .advice$  the counts and what to do about it — including the sentence
#             @emlDrawTimeSeries already wrote, which names the graph type
#             that would show what this one cannot. Info window ONLY: it is a
#             paragraph, not a caption. Pass "" when there is nothing to add.

# Say, on the figure and in the Info window, that a typed axis range withheld
# points -- and say which range did it.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE PROCEDURE AND NOT TWO INLINE COPIES. The two scatter paths
# (grouped and ungrouped) both need this, and a disclosure that is worded one
# way for one path and another way for the other is a disclosure a reader
# cannot compare across two figures of the same data.
#
# THE SECOND THING IT ANSWERS. A user who fills in a MINIMUM and leaves the
# maximum on automatic has that pair silently reordered into (0, minimum)
# before it reaches any draw procedure -- so "show me everything above 300"
# becomes "show me everything below 300", which is the exact opposite. The
# reordering happens in the
# form's range-validation block and cannot be undone from here: by the time
# this library is called the pair is (0, 300) and is indistinguishable from a
# (0, 300) a user typed on purpose.
#
# What CAN be done from here, and is, is to refuse to let the consequence
# pass unremarked. A range that silently inverted the user's intent will
# nearly always leave data outside itself, and this line names the count AND
# prints the range that produced it, so a user who typed 300 as a floor reads
# "axis range 0-300" back and sees immediately that it was taken as a
# ceiling. It is issued from the only layer that can issue it.
#
# .xSetMin/.xSetMax and .ySetMin/.ySetMax are the pairs AS PASSED IN -- 0/0
# meaning automatic -- so the advice can name only the axis the user actually
# constrained. .xLo/.xHi/.yLo/.yHi are the frame that was drawn.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NO `goto` AND NO `label`, AND THAT IS A RULE RATHER THAN A STYLE. v27 reads
# this whole file and asserts there is neither, because Praat's goto is
# unconditional and a forward jump can skip past an `Axes:` and every drawing
# command after it -- which is how the histogram once wrote a blank page. The
# early return this procedure obviously wants is therefore written as an
# ordinary `if`, and v27 is what said so: the first version used a goto, did
# no drawing at all, and was caught anyway. A rule that only applies to the
# procedures you think could be harmed is not a rule.

# omnibus line to annotBlockN AFTER the draw procedure returns and renders the
# block itself; lines left behind here would be drawn a second time, in a
# second box.
#
# THE CORNER. Two boxes can be on an annotated categorical figure at once —
# this one, and the form's omnibus box. The form's corner is not negotiable
# and not visible to @emlPlaceElements: eml-graphs-form.praat sends it to
# "bottom-right" when there are brackets and "top-right" when there are not.
# Drawn 7 Aug 2026 without this guard, an annotated violin plot with two
# significance brackets put BOTH boxes in the bottom-right corner and the
# Kruskal-Wallis line was painted over the top of "6 row(s) skip…".
#
# Rather than second-guess @emlPlaceElements, the corners that are already
# spoken for — the legend's, and the form's — are declared BUSY by adding a
# large occupancy weight to their quadrants. That is the currency
# @emlPlaceElements already reasons in, so the library keeps making the
# choice and this procedure only tells it what is in the way.
#
# The form's rule is duplicated here, which is a coupling worth naming: the
# right long-term fix is for the form to route its omnibus line through this
# same block instead of rendering a second one, and that is a change in
# eml-graphs-form.praat.

# DRAWING PROCEDURES
# ============================================================================
# The 15 drawing procedures themselves, counted by the rule stated under
# Procedures at the top of this file. Fourteen of them are reached from the
# DISPATCH (DRAW) block of eml-graphs-form.praat, whose 13 graph_type branches
# cover all fourteen — branch 5 chooses between @emlDrawTimeSeries and
# @emlDrawTimeSeriesCI — and each signature here matches its call there.
# @emlDrawLMMForest is the fifteenth: it is not on that dispatch, takes no
# arguments, and is called from plugin/scripts/eml-lmm.praat.
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlDrawF0Contour
# Draws a publication-quality F0 contour from a Pitch object.
# Source: v1.0 (17 Feb 2026), adapted for plugin dispatch signature.
# Y-axis unit option (Hz or semitones re 440 Hz). The queries, the
#        auto-range and the draw command all branch on the unit.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Requires: @emlInitDrawingDefaults (or manual global initialization).
# Reads globals: emlPanelOriginX, emlPanelOriginY (via @emlSetAdaptiveTheme).
# ============================================================================
# @emlDrawColumnIsClean: .tableId, .colName$
# ============================================================================
# Can this column be read with the fast path? Returns .clean, 1 or 0.
#
# THIS EXISTS SO THE FIGURE AND THE ANALYSIS EXCLUDE THE SAME ROWS.
#
# `number (Get value: ...)` -- Praat's own numericiser -- is the LENIENT
# test, and the stats path does not use it. A draw procedure's row filter
# that did would make the two layers disagree about which rows are usable.
# Measured, on a fixture with one awkward cell per row
# (harness/disclosure/probe_exclusion_parity.praat):
#
#     cell '1,5'   stats: dropped      figure: plotted as 1
#     cell '30%'   stats: dropped      figure: plotted as 0.3
#
#     @eml_getGroupData group A   ->  n=2, excluded=5
#     @emlDrawViolinPlot           ->  four points, "3 row(s) skipped"
#
# The omnibus line the form paints onto the figure would then describe a
# different data set from the figure, and the disclosure line -- this
# plugin's own promise that what was dropped is stated -- would be true of the
# figure and false of the analysis printed beside it.
#
# The argument is the same one the stats path makes about a mean, and it
# applies unchanged to a point on a page: a European decimal comma silently
# becoming a different number is not more defensible plotted than averaged.
# So the draw layer reads cells with @eml_readCell, the same reader
# @emlExtractColumn uses.
#
# WHY A COLUMN-LEVEL TEST AND NOT JUST @eml_readCell EVERYWHERE.
# @eml_readCell's fast path is a plain `Get value:`, which is only safe on a
# column already proven strictly numeric with no empty cells -- exactly the
# gate @emlExtractColumn applies before its own row loop. Asking once per
# column means a clean column costs one extra test for the whole figure, and
# only a column that actually contains something ambiguous pays for per-cell
# classification. @eml_strictNumericColumn copies the table to probe the
# numericiser, so calling it per row would be indefensible; calling it once
# is what the stats path already does.
#
# THE GRAPHS LAYER DEPENDING ON THE STATS LAYER IS NOT NEW. @emlDrawViolinPlot
# already calls @emlCountGroups from plugin/stats/eml-extract.praat, which is
# why harness/stress_cases/_prelude.praat loads the stats files to render a
# figure.

        # room a figure needs is a property of what is drawn on it, not of
        # the unit, and is supplied by @emlComputeAnnotationHeadroom at the
        # annotation stage.
        #
        # WHY THERE IS A FLOOR AT ALL. "No minimum span" is right for two
        # hertz and wrong for two millionths of one. A
        # synthesised 200 Hz tone yields a pitch track spanning 9.7e-06 Hz --
        # measured, harness/graphaxes/cases/repro_steady_pitch.praat -- and
        # an axis that follows the data to 1.4e-05 Hz wide draws that
        # rounding noise at full frame height. The published figure is a
        # sustained note rendered as chaos, over six y-ticks all reading
        # "200". A singing teacher would put it in a handout.
        #
        # A floor in HERTZ would be wrong: two hertz is a semitone and a half
        # at a bass's 100 Hz and a fifth of one at a high soprano's 1000, so
        # a fixed floor over-magnifies one voice and flattens another. The
        # floor is therefore stated in the unit the ear works in. Ten cents
        # is a tenth of a semitone, at the bottom of what a trained listener
        # can resolve at all, so nothing the figure declines to magnify is
        # anything a singer could hear or a teacher could act on -- and
        # everything above it survives untouched.
        #
        # TEN CENTS AND NOT TWENTY, and the difference was measured, not
        # chosen. The verifier's own 199->201 Hz ramp spans 1.84 Hz, which is
        # 16 cents at that register: a twenty-cent floor would have caught a
        # figure the verifier had already established draws CORRECTLY, and
        # announced a correction it did not need. Ten cents leaves that ramp
        # alone (1.84 Hz against a 1.16 Hz floor) and still opens the
        # sustained tone's 0.0000097 Hz by five orders of magnitude.
        #
        # IT ONLY EVER WIDENS, AND ONLY ON THE AUTO PATH. A user's typed
        # range is taken literally further down; the data are never moved,
        # scaled or clipped by this -- a value at 200.0000043 sits at
        # 200.0000043 on the widened axis exactly as it did on the narrow
        # one, with more empty axis around it. That is the whole change, and

        # Verifier's probe (aud65_out_verify65.log.md, reconfirmed here on

    ; ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; ONE BIN IN RANGE DRAWS AS A STEM -- "draw what you can".
    ;
    ; WHY. Praat's Spectrum `Draw:` joins bin points with line SEGMENTS,
    ; and one point is no segment. A frequency window holding exactly one
    ; bin therefore gets a titled, labelled, gridded, tick-marked frame
    ; with ZERO ink inside it from `Draw:` alone -- and the bin it will
    ; not draw is the one holding the peak of the tone. Two bins draw
    ; normally, which is the control that says this is about the COUNT
    ; and not about the range. Nothing raises, nothing warns, and the
    ; file is a large PNG either way -- 48,870 bytes on the fixture below
    ; -- so nothing that thresholds on size can see it either.
    ;
    ; HOW REACHABLE THIS IS. Praat's bin width is 1/duration (after the
    ; zero-pad to
    ; a power of two), so the window that triggers this scales with how
    ; SHORT the recording is. A 3 s vowel needs a sub-hertz window --
    ; absurd. A 0.15 s token pads to 0.1858 s and gets 5.3833 Hz bins, so
    ; ANY zoom narrower than about 10.7 Hz draws nothing at all. Measured
    ; 16 Aug 2026 on 6.6.30: a 1 kHz tone in a 0.15 s token, drawn over
    ; 998..1002 Hz, one bin in range (#187) holding 80.34 dB, zero ink.
    ; Short tokens are what phonetics is made of.
    ;
    ; SO A SINGLE IN-RANGE BIN IS DRAWN AS A STEM to the frame floor --
    ; a mark that needs no second point.
    ; A stem rather than a dot, for three reasons: a spectrum's meaning is
    ; height above the floor, so a mark that carries that height reads as
    ; the same quantity the curve carries; a lone dot in an otherwise
    ; empty panel gives the eye no reference to judge it against; and a
    ; stem cannot be misread as a data series that happens to have one
    ; point in it. It is Praat's own idiom for a single spectral line --
    ; the "Bars" style an Ltas draws with.
    ;
    ; ZERO BINS IN RANGE STAYS EMPTY. There is genuinely nothing to draw:
    ; no bin of this Spectrum lies in the window the caller asked for, and
    ; inventing a mark for it would be a claim about data that is not
    ; there. The frame, its ticks and its labels still state the window,
    ; which is the honest report of "you are looking somewhere there is
    ; nothing".
    ;
    ; THE dB CONVERSION IS PRAAT'S OWN, MEASURED RATHER THAN DERIVED. The
    ; obvious formula, 10*log10 ((re^2+im^2) / 4e-10), is NOT what `Draw:`
    ; plots -- it is 10.32 dB low on the fixture above. What `Draw:` plots
    ; is the spectral density, which is the same quantity `To Ltas
    ; (1-to-1)` returns, and that is the bin width factor below. Verified
    ; 16 Aug 2026 against Praat's own `To Ltas (1-to-1)` at five different
    ; bin widths (delta = 0 at every one), and pinned in validate/v67 by a
    ; pixel measurement: the stem's tip must sit on the SAME image row as
    ; the vertex Praat's own `Draw:` puts there for the same bin.

        ; ONE BIN IN RANGE DRAWS AS A STEM -- "draw what you can", the same
        ; mark the Spectrum path draws above, for the same reason.
        ;
        ; WHY. Praat's Ltas `Draw:` in "Curve" style joins the bins whose
        ; CENTRES fall inside the window with line segments, and one point is
        ; no segment. A window holding exactly one bin therefore gets a
        ; titled, labelled, gridded, tick-marked frame with ZERO ink inside
        ; it from `Draw:` alone -- and the bin it will not draw is the one the
        ; user zoomed in on. "Bars" draws the same bin perfectly well, which
        ; is the control that says this is about the COUNT and about this
        ; STYLE, not about the range or the data. Nothing raises and nothing
        ; warns; the file is a large PNG either way.
        ;
        ; MEASURED ON 6.6.30. A 1 kHz tone, `To Ltas: 100`,
        ; window 1000 .. 1100 Hz: one bin in range (#11, centre 1050 Hz,
        ; 66.95 dB), Curve 0 ink, Bars 5486 ink on the same bin. Widen the
        ; window by one bin -- 1000 .. 1150 -- and Curve draws normally. The
        ; centre-in-window count below predicts Praat's own behaviour exactly:
        ; 1000 .. 1149, with bin 12's centre one hertz outside, still draws
        ; nothing, so no segment is being clipped in from beyond the edge.
        ;
        ; WHY IT IS MORE REACHABLE THAN THE SPECTRUM'S. A Spectrum's bin width
        ; is 1/duration, so the window that triggers the Spectrum's version of
        ; this scales with how short the recording is and a long recording is
        ; safe. An Ltas bin width is the BANDWIDTH THE CALLER CHOSE -- 100 Hz
        ; from the form's own default -- so a 100 Hz window does it at any
        ; recording length whatever. And Curve is the FALLBACK this procedure
        ; installs a dozen lines above when the caller enables none of the
        ; four styles, so it is the style a user reaches without choosing it.
        ;
        ; A STEM, NOT A FALL BACK TO "BARS", AND THE REASON IS THAT BARS IS A
        ; USER-VISIBLE SETTING HERE. In this procedure Curve and Bars are two
        ; independent checkboxes on the form, drawn in two different palette
        ; colours from the same sequence. Rendering Curve as Bars whenever the
        ; window narrows to one bin would hand a user who turned Bars OFF the
        ; display they turned off, and would hand a user who turned BOTH on
        ; the same bin twice -- once in the Bars colour and once, on top of it,
        ; in the Curve colour, a filled rectangle over a filled rectangle
        ; where the second is meant to be a line. The stem is drawn in the
        ; Curve layer's own colour and its own line width, it cannot be
        ; mistaken for the Bars layer, and it is the same mark the Spectrum
        ; path draws for the same reason -- one procedure's degenerate case
        ; should not look like a different procedure's normal one.
        ;
        ; TO THE FRAME FLOOR, like the Spectrum's stem: a Curve has no origin
        ; of its own -- it is a height, and the only reference on the page for
        ; that height is the axis. "Poles" above deliberately uses 0 dB
        ; instead, because a pole IS a statement about the 0 dB reference;
        ; that difference is intended and the two must not be merged.
        ;
        ; NO dB CONVERSION HERE, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS DIFFERS FROM
        ; THE SPECTRUM. A Spectrum stores re/im and `Draw:` plots the spectral
        ; density, so that path has to reconstruct a quantity Praat never
        ; hands it. `Get value in bin` on an Ltas returns the dB value `Draw:`
        ; itself plots, so the stem takes it unchanged. VERIFIED IN PIXELS
        ; rather than assumed: on the two-bin window above, a hand-drawn stem
        ; at bin 11 tops out on image row 436 at column 537, and the vertex
        ; Praat's own "Curve" puts at that bin is at row 436, column 537.

        ; Spectrum path settled them. There is nothing in the window; the

# @emlDrawTimeSeries
# Draws a publication-quality time series plot: one line, or one line per
# group, with a marker at every plotted vertex.
#
# Drawing modes (determined by column configuration):
#   A — No group column: a single line
#   D — Group column: one line per group (grouped time series)
#
# There are no modes B and C. They were spaghetti strands keyed on an ID
# column, with an optional mean overlay, and they were reverted — the banner
# immediately below has said so the whole time this header contradicted it.
# The signature is the proof: no .idCol$, no .showMean, and no band columns
# either, so there is no CI band for mode A here.
# Individual traces are @emlDrawSpaghettiPlot; a CI band is
# @emlDrawTimeSeriesCI.
#
# The group count is not capped. The palette gives each group one of
# 8 Okabe-Ito hues AND one of 3 marker shapes, so 24 groups are drawn
# distinguishably; past 24 the (hue, shape) pair repeats.

    # Long format -- the shape every EML stats tool emits and every EML demo
    # table uses -- has several observations per time, and the result was a
    # figure that could invert the trend it was drawing.
    #
    # Worked example, two rising subjects: (1,10) (1,20) (2,12) (2,22)
    # (3,14) (3,24). Sorted, the segments are 10->20 vertical at x=1, then

    # equal, and in @emlDrawScatterPlot they are NOT: there .xMin/.xMax are
    # the procedure's PARAMETERS, carrying what the caller REQUESTED, with
    # (0, 0) meaning auto. So `.xMin` means "resolved" in nine procedures and
    # "requested" in one, and a caller reading it uniformly would silently get
    # 0 for a scatter's auto range instead of a wrong-variable error. That is
    # the failure this contract exists to prevent, and aliasing the two
    # spellings together would have preserved it under a tidier name.

    ; RECORD WORKFLOW. Inert unless a recording is running.
    ;
    ; PLACED IN THE DRAW PROCEDURE, NOT IN THE FORM, and that is the whole
    ; reason the graph round trip can run at all. The form is GUI-only --
    ; every wrapper uses beginPause:, which needs a display -- so a recorder
    ; hooked there could be exercised interactively and never headlessly, and
    ; the check that the emitted script reproduces the figure could never be
    ; automated. The draw procedure has no dialogs, so recording here means
    ; the SAME seam serves the GUI session and the replay.
    ;
    ; It also matches what is emitted: the code line names this procedure,
    ; so the record and the artifact describe one thing.
    ;
    ; This is the FIRST of thirteen draw procedures to be wired, kept
    ; deliberately to one until the round trip proves the pattern -- the same
    ; way @emlRunAnovaAnalysis was the first of thirteen orchestrators.
    ; GUARDED ON EXISTENCE, NOT JUST ON STATE, and that distinction is the
    ; difference between a recordable draw layer and one that REQUIRES the
    ; recorder.
    ;
    ; The first cut called @emlRecordViolin unconditionally, which made
    ; eml-draw-procedures.praat depend on eml-record.praat: seven include
    ; sets had to be amended and the stress suite went 39/39 -> 26/39 with
    ; "Procedure emlRecordInit not found". That is a shipped API break --
    ; every hand-written user script and every PraatGen-generated script that
    ; loads the draw layer would have had to learn a new include, for a
    ; feature it does not use.
    ;
    ; Praat only errors on an undefined procedure when it EXECUTES the call,
    ; so a call inside a false branch costs nothing and raises nothing.
    ; Measured 10 Aug 2026: a guarded @thisProcedureDoesNotExist runs to the
    ; end of the script cleanly.
    ;
    ; PRESENT, THEN INITIALISED, THEN RECORDING -- three things, and the first
    ; version conflated the first two.
    ;
    ; It tested variableExists ("emlRecordActive"), which is set by
    ; @emlRecordInit. That was sufficient while a recording lived inside one
    ; script scope. A menu command runs in a FRESH scope where nothing has
    ; called @emlRecordInit yet, so the variable did not exist, the guard was
    ; false, and EVERY FIGURE DRAWN FROM THE MENU WENT UNRECORDED while the
    ; recording itself was running perfectly. The ANOVA hook escaped it only
    ; because @emlRecordAnova calls @emlRecordInit before testing anything.

    ; to decide whether to compute the axis from the data. Recording the
    ; RESOLVED numbers in its place is not a more faithful record: it is a

    # THE PALETTE CEILING. @emlSetColorPalette defines a style as a pair —
    # one of EIGHT hues and one of THREE fill patterns (solid, diagonal
    # hatch, dots) — so it holds 24 sub-group styles that are distinguishable
    # from one another both on the figure and in the legend. Past 24 the pair
    # repeats and a sub-group would be drawn exactly like one already on the
    # figure. The cap is a real limit of the palette, not an arbitrary
    # number.
    #
    # The ceiling is deliberately generous: "make the
    # boundary in excess of what we think is reasonable... maybe there's some
    # person who wants to do a twenty four participant comparison, and
    # they're gonna make their figure sixty inches wide. Like, we just don't
    # know." Twenty-four sub-violins on a default 6-inch figure are NOT
    # readable — see the rendered evidence in the v29 header — but that is
    # the user's judgement to make on their own figure width, and the drawing
    # code is correct at every count up to 24.
    #
    # The old ceiling was ten because ten fill/line pairs were declared, and
    # that number was WRONG IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: slots 9 and 10 were literal
    # duplicates of 1 and 2, so a ten-sub-group figure already drew two pairs
    # Of sub-groups identically and said nothing, while eight genuinely
    # distinct styles were being refused a legitimate eleventh.
    #
    # AND THE CAP IS SAID OUT LOUD. The extraction guard below drops
    # sub-groups past the cap; that count is carried to Step 10B and
    # disclosed, `legendN` is capped to what was actually drawn so the legend
    # cannot list a sub-group with no violin anywhere on the figure, and the
    # slot geometry below divides the category by the DRAWN count so the
    # remaining violins stay centred rather than leaving a phantom gap where
    # the dropped ones would have been.

# @emlDrawLMMForest — fixed-effect coefficient forest plot for a fitted LMM.
# ============================================================================
# Reads emlLMM.* (beta#, nFixedCols, formula$), emlWaldCI.* (lower#, upper#)
# and the coefficient labels emlModelMatrix.colName'.j'$. Call after @emlLMM
# and @emlWaldCI. Draws each fixed effect as a point estimate with its 95%
# confidence interval and a zero reference line (a "forest"/coefficient plot —
# the standard LMM graphic). Rule 28: title, garnish suppressed + manual marks,
# viewport asserted, sanitized labels, buffered axis always including zero.
#
# Takes no arguments — the LMM tool calls it as @emlDrawLMMForest. Unlike the
# other draw procedures it is not reached through the graphs form, so the
# display-toggle globals that form normally sets may be undefined; they are
# seeded here rather than assumed (see the guard below).
# Requires: nothing. Reads globals: emlShow* and colorMode$ if already set.
