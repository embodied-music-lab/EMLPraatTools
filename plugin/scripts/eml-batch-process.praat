# Batch Voice Analysis
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Batch process a folder of Sound files to extract user-selected
#          acoustic measures (mean F0, mean intensity, jitter, shimmer, HNR,
#          CPPS), optionally constrained to labeled TextGrid intervals.
#          Results are exported to a CSV file with one row per analysis
#          segment.

# NEVER TRUNCATE SOMEONE ELSE'S FILE. @emlInitSentinel writes with
# writeFileLine:, which TRUNCATES. Until 14 August 2026 the sentinel path was
# hard-wired to <sound folder>/STOP.txt, so a user who kept their own STOP.txt
# — a note to a collaborator, a stop-word list, a marker file — lost it the
# moment they ran a batch: silently, with no prompt and no undo. The results
# CSV has walked to a free name on collision as of that change; the sentinel did not.
# This procedure is the missing half of that protection.
#
# A path that does NOT exist is ours to make. A path that exists is ours only
# if its whole FIRST LINE is RUN or STOP — the line @emlInitSentinel writes and
# the one edit the Info window asks the user to make.
#
# THE FIRST LINE, NOT THE FIRST WORD, and that distinction is not theoretical:
# the first draft of this procedure tested the first word, and the end-to-end
# drive on 14 Aug 2026 destroyed a file whose first line was "Stop list for
# this study" — the very failure this exists to prevent, reproduced by the
# guard meant to stop it. A file that BEGINS with the word stop is exactly what
# a human writes in a file they name STOP.txt.
#
# `length = n and index_caseInsensitive (...) = 1` is then a WHOLE-LINE
# case-insensitive compare, deliberately stricter than @emlCheckStopSentinel's
# substring test: deciding whether to destroy a file is not the place to accept
# "stopwords" as evidence that we wrote it. "run", "Run" and "STOP" alone on
# the line are ours; "Running order" and "STOP — ask Ian first" are not.
#
# BLANKS EITHER SIDE ARE TRIMMED, because a text editor and a human both leave
# them, and because @emlCheckStopSentinel — the halt test on the same file —
# uses extractWord$ and so already ignores them. A file this script would STOP
# for must be a file this script is willing to own; disagreeing would leave a
# user whose "  STOP" halted one run watching the next run write STOP_2.txt.
#
# unicode$ (13) is trimmed with them as belt and braces only. Measured on
# 6.4.06, 14 Aug 2026: readFile$ normalises both CRLF and lone-CR line endings
# to newline$, so no CR survives to be seen — but the trim costs nothing and
# the day that stops being true is not a day to lose a file.
#
# AN EMPTY FILE IS NOT OURS. It is far more likely to be the user's placeholder
# than a sentinel of ours that died halfway through its first line, and the
# cost of being wrong is asymmetric: refusing a file we did write costs one
# extra STOP_2.txt, truncating a file we did not costs the user their data.

#
# ONE DIFFERENCE, AND IT IS ON PURPOSE. The CSV's walk stops at a name that is
# FREE, because a previous run's results must never be overwritten. The
# sentinel's stops at a name that is free OR ALREADY OURS, because the sentinel
# is a control file we rewrite at the start of every run: if a foreign STOP.txt
# sits in the output folder and we insisted on a free name, every run would
# leave one more STOP_2.txt, STOP_3.txt … behind forever. Neither test can pick
# a foreign file, which is the property that matters.

# @emlWarnNearRangeEnd: .lo, .hi, .floor, .ceiling, .what$   →  .fired
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ONE PROCEDURE FOR ALL THREE BOUNDED RANGES, and the reason is arithmetic
# rather than tidiness. APPENDIX_D §7's rule — "GUARD BOTH ENDS OF EVERY
# BOUNDED RANGE (hard) … A floor-only guard is half a guard" — has to be
# applied to three ranges in this module (filtered autocorrelation, raw cross-
# correlation, the cepstral peak search), which is six comparisons. Written out
# at each site that is six chances to drop a `<` or to write the ceiling test
# against the floor, and the appendix's observed failure is precisely a missing
# half. Written once it is one place to read and one place to break.
#
# THE MARGIN IS 10%, WHICH IS THE APPENDIX'S OWN. Its worked example calls a
# maximum of 322.87 Hz against a 330 Hz ceiling — 97.8% of it — the failure to
# report, and its sample code is `if maxF0 > 0.9 * ceiling`. The floor test is
# the mirror: within 10% ABOVE the floor, so `.lo < .floor * 1.1`. Note that
# these are not symmetric in ratio (0.9 × ceiling versus 1.1 × floor rather
# than 1/0.9), and the appendix is followed rather than tidied.
#
# WHY IT COUNTS INSTEAD OF INCREMENTING. A procedure cannot touch the caller's
# nWarnings without naming a global, and a procedure in this file that reached
# out and changed a counter would be the one thing in it that did. So it
# returns .fired — 0, 1 or 2 — and the caller adds it. That also makes the
# arithmetic visible at the call site, which matters because S7C's counter is
# what the closing summary reports.
#
# A RANGE END IS APPROACHED, NOT EXCEEDED, and the wording says so. The value
# came back inside the range because it could not come back outside one: a
# tracker asked for 50-800 Hz reports something in 50-800 Hz whatever the voice
# did. That is why "censored" is the right word and why this warning cannot be
# derived from the value alone — which is the whole reason the plausibility
# bands above cannot cover this and a second kind of check is needed.
#
# UNDEFINED IS NOT A NEAR MISS. Measured on Praat 6.6.30, 16 August 2026, both
# `undefined < 55` and `undefined > 297` are FALSE, so the guards below would
# be silent even unwritten; they are written because an unvoiced segment is
# already reported once by the plausibility block and must not be reported
# twice, and because a build that changed that answer would otherwise turn
# every silent segment into two warnings.

# @emlAppendFailureRow: .table, .row, .stem$, .why$
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A FILE THAT CANNOT BE ANALYSED IS A ROW, NOT AN ABSENCE. Until 14 August 2026
# this script had no containment of any kind: `Read from file:` was unguarded,
# so ONE zero-length recording — the thing a stopped or disconnected interface
# leaves behind — aborted the entire batch with Praat's own "Data not read from
# text file" and took every row already computed with it, because the CSV is
# written after the loop and an abort never reaches it. An overnight run over
# 500 files ended at file 372 with nothing on disk and no indication which file
# had done it.
#
# THE ROW IS THE POINT. A file quietly missing from a results CSV is invisible
# — the reader counts rows against a corpus they half remember, or does not
# count at all. A row that says FAILED and why is the one form of this that a
# person notices, and it keeps the CSV's row count equal to the number of files
# the batch was asked for, which is the property that makes the count checkable
# at all.
#
# NO COMMAS IN .why$. Praat's "Save as comma-separated file" does not quote the
# fields it writes, so a comma in this string silently becomes a column break
# and shifts every measure on that row one place to the right. Measured on
# 6.6.30, 14 Aug 2026. Use a semicolon or a dash.
#
# The measure columns are left UNSET rather than filled with a sentinel number.
# Praat writes an unset numeric cell as an empty field, which read.csv and every
# other reader takes as NA — a missing value, which is exactly what it is. A
# 0 or a -999 in that cell would be averaged by somebody.

# @emlEnsureOutputFolder: .folder$, .probePath$   →  .writable
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE FOLDER IS MADE, NOT ASSUMED — the same reasoning as @emlSavePanel in
# stats/eml-output.praat (14 Aug 2026): `folder:` is a freely editable text
# field with a Browse button beside it, so the user can type a path that does
# not exist yet, and typing one is the natural thing to do when you want this
# batch's results in their own folder.
#
# EVERY LEVEL IS MADE, NOT JUST THE LAST ONE. Measured on Praat 6.4.06,
# 14 Aug 2026: createFolder: creates ONE level — it is mkdir, not mkdir -p —
# and refuses outright when the parent is missing. "~/Documents/Study A/run 1"
# is exactly the kind of path a user types into this field, and typing the
# whole thing at once is the normal way to do it, so the parents are created
# here in turn. The scan is for BOTH separators, per the truth table at "Last
# path component of the sound folder": a folder typed on Windows arrives as
# "C:\Users\ian\Study A" and a scan for "/" alone would find no levels at all.
# A prefix ending in ":" is a drive root, which exists and is not ours to
# create, so it is skipped.
#
# WHY IT IS ALSO PROVED WRITABLE, which the save panel does not do. This script
# runs unattended for a long time, and the CSV is written at the END: a folder
# that cannot be written would otherwise be discovered after the whole batch
# had run, with the results in a Table and Praat's own error — "Cannot create
# file …" — as the only explanation. The probe is what turns every way this can
# fail — unmakeable path, read-only folder, full disk — into one message,
# before any audio is read.
#
# The probe is the sentinel itself rather than a scratch file: it is the first
# thing this script writes anyway, the caller has already resolved it to a path
# that is free or ours, and a scratch file would need its own collision walk
# not to delete something of the user's.
#
# nocheck GUARDS EXACTLY ONE COMMAND — the one it prefixes — and is used here
# so a refusal becomes a message this script can write instead of a Praat abort
# the user has to interpret. .writable is set BEFORE the nochecks and only
# raised inside an if, never assigned on the line following one (M4 in
# audit/static: a failing nocheck can corrupt the next assignment).

# THE OUTPUT FOLDER, AND WHY ITS DEFAULT IS NOT THE SOUND FOLDER.
#
# THE STOP FILE AND THE CSV BOTH GO TO THE USER'S DESIGNATED OUTPUT FOLDER,
# never to the input folder.
#
# Writing them beside the AUDIO would put STOP.txt and the results CSV into
# the folder of recordings this script is reading, which is the user's corpus
# and often someone else's shared data.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS PART OF IT, not decoration. An empty default that
# falls back to the sound folder was considered and rejected: it would preserve
# today's behaviour for existing users at the price of re-creating the exact
# defect for every user who does not edit the field — and the users who do not
# edit fields are precisely the ones the truncation would surprise. A default
# is what most runs will actually use, so it has to be a folder the rule
# allows.
#
# HOME, IN A NAMED FOLDER. homeDirectory$ exists and is writable on every
# platform Praat runs on, so the pre-filled path works with one click; it is
# outside the corpus, so nothing this script writes can ever land among the
# recordings; and the name says what is in it, so a user who has forgotten
# where their results went can find them. It is also exactly ONE level below a
# folder that is certain to exist, so the default is creatable by the plainest
# possible means and never leans on the ancestor-creating loop in
# @emlEnsureOutputFolder, which exists for the paths users type by hand.
#
# NOT preferencesDirectory$, though the plugin uses it for the review copies in
# eml-record-open.praat (13 Aug 2026). That folder is for things the plugin
# owns and the user is not meant to keep; a batch's results are the deliverable
# and belong where a user will look for them.

# validate/v72_batch_registration.R closes it: v72 reads the fourth and fifth
# arguments of the shipped `Get CPPS:` line and requires them to equal these
# two assignments. Change either end alone and the suite goes red.

# THE SHORTEST SEGMENT THE SELECTED MEASURES CAN ACTUALLY BE ASKED FOR
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A SEGMENT TOO SHORT FOR ITS ANALYSIS WINDOW IS NOT A WARNING, IT IS AN ABORT.
# Until 14 August 2026 this script warned — "measures may be undefined" — and
# then ran the analysis anyway. Praat does not return undefined for a sound
# shorter than the window. It refuses, and a refusal inside `To Pitch` ends the
# script:
#
#     Error: To analyse this Sound, "pitch floor" must not be less than 300 Hz.
#     Sound "b_tiny": pitch analysis (filtered AC) not performed.
#
# `Save as comma-separated file:` sits after the loop, so that abort discards
# every row already computed. One truncated take — a clipped trigger, a
# mis-trimmed interval, a 20 ms TextGrid label — and a whole night's batch
# writes nothing. Same shape as the unguarded read; same fix, a failed row.
#
# THE THRESHOLDS ARE MEASURED, NOT DERIVED. Praat's requirement is a multiple
# of the analysis window, and the multiple differs by command, so the only
# honest source is the binary. Bisected on Praat 6.6.30 (linux), 14 August
# 2026, with each command's canonical APPENDIX_D parameter set, on a 44.1 kHz
# periodic complex — the shortest duration at which each command SUCCEEDS:
#
#     To Pitch (filtered autocorrelation)  floor 50    0.06  s   (= 3 / 50)
#     To Pitch (raw cross-correlation)     floor 75    0.03  s
#     To Intensity                         floor 100   0.064 s   (= 6.4 / 100)
#     To Harmonicity (cc)                  floor 75    0.03  s
#     To PowerCepstrogram                  floor 60    0.10  s   (= 6 / 60)
#
# CPPS is therefore the binding constraint whenever it is selected, at nearly
# double the 0.064 s a naive threshold would warn at — which is why a
# threshold could not have been used as a guard even if it had been one: a
# 0.08 s segment passed it and then killed the run inside the cepstrogram.
#
# THE MAXIMUM OVER THE SELECTED MEASURES, not a fixed constant, because the
# guard must refuse exactly the segments that would abort. A fixed 0.1 s would
# refuse an 0.08 s segment that a mean-F0-only run measures perfectly well, and
# a fixed 0.06 s would let that same segment through into a CPPS run.

# the Objects window but `Save as comma-separated file:` sits after the loop and
# never runs, so an overnight batch of 400 files that reached file 399 writes no
# CSV at all. One mistyped digit in "End at file" is the entire failure.
#
# A start index past the end is the quieter half of the same mistake: the for
# loop simply never runs, and the user gets an empty CSV and a summary reading

    #
    #   0-byte  .wav   Error: No lines. / Data not read from text file …
    #   text in a .wav  same — Praat falls back to its text-object reader
    #
    # Either ends the script at exit 255. The CSV is written after the loop, so
    # a corpus with one zero-length take — what a stopped interface or a full
    # disk leaves behind — produces NO results at all, however many files were
    # analysed before it. That is the failure this guard exists for, and the
    # row is the other half of it: the run must also say WHICH file.
    #
    # WHY THE SELECTION IS EMPTIED FIRST. `nocheck` swallows the error but
    # leaves no return value to test, so the outcome has to be read off the
    # Objects window — and that is only unambiguous if nothing was selected
    # going in. After `minusObject: fileListId` the three outcomes separate
    # cleanly (all measured, same session):
    #
    #   read succeeded          1 object selected, and it is a Sound
    #   read failed             0 objects selected
    #   read gave a non-Sound   1 object selected, 0 of them Sounds
    #
    # The third is not hypothetical: a TextGrid saved with a .wav extension
    # reads perfectly well and is not something this script can analyse. It is
    # removed here rather than left in the Objects window to accumulate.
    #
    # `Remove` IS ONLY EVER REACHED WITH EXACTLY THE NEW OBJECT SELECTED, which

        # ========================================================

        # A PLAUSIBILITY BAND AND AN ANALYSIS RANGE ARE NOT THE SAME THING,
        # and until this block existed only the first kind was guarded. The
        # six checks above ask whether a RESULT is believable — is 1400 Hz a
        # credible mean F0. This one asks something the result cannot answer:
        # whether the SEARCH that produced it was wide enough to have found
        # the answer at all. A pitch tracker asked to look between 50 and
        # 1000 Hz does not report failure when the voice sits at 48; it
        # reports 50-something, in band, in the CSV, indistinguishable from a
        # measurement. The number is censored, not wrong, and nothing about
        # its value says so.
        #
        # APPENDIX_D §7 states the rule as "GUARD BOTH ENDS OF EVERY BOUNDED
        # RANGE (hard)" and gives the observed failure verbatim: a script
        # warned when minimum F0 came within 10% of the pitch floor and had
        # no equivalent at the top, and a real recording measured 322.87 Hz
        # against a cepstral search ceiling of 330 — 98% of it — in silence.
        # The 10% margin and the "widen the range or treat the result as
        # censored" reading are the appendix's, not this file's.
        #
        # THREE BOUNDED RANGES LIVE IN THIS MODULE, and they do not coincide:
        #
        #   filtered autocorrelation   50 .. facPitchTop      mean F0
        #   raw cross-correlation      75 .. rccPitchCeiling  jitter, shimmer
        #   cepstral peak search       60 .. 330              CPPS
        #
        # The floors are 50, 75 and 60 Hz — three different numbers, so a
        # single guard against the lowest of them would pass a segment that
        # two of the three could not measure. The RCC floor is the one that
        # bites in practice: an 80 Hz bass is 60% above the FAC floor and 7%
        # above the RCC floor, so his mean F0 is trustworthy and the
        # PointProcess underneath his jitter and shimmer is not.
        #
        # EVERY RANGE THAT EXISTS IS GUARDED AGAINST ITS OWN LIMITS, and the
        # first draft of this block did not do that. It picked ONE track to
        # speak for the segment — filtered autocorrelation when it existed —
        # and guarded the 50 Hz FAC floor with it. On the very corpus written
        # to test it, a 78 Hz take with all six measures ticked produced no
        # warning at all: 78 clears the FAC floor by 56%, and the raw-cross-
        # correlation track underneath its jitter and shimmer, which cannot
        # look below 75, was never asked. A guard that inspects the widest of
        # several ranges reports on the one least likely to bite.
        #
        # So each track answers for itself below, and the ONE PLACE a single
        # representative F0 is genuinely needed — the CPPS search window and
        # the stated-value comparison, neither of which has a track of its
        # own — takes FAC when it exists, because F0 tracking is the purpose
        # APPENDIX_D §1A appoints FAC to, and RCC when it is all there is.
        # Neither existing is not a silent no-op: the header printed a NOTE
        # before a single file was read, because a guard that quietly does not
        # run is this block's own failure mode arriving one level up.
        #
        # NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A NUMBER. Every branch below appends to the
        # Info window and increments nWarnings. No Table cell, no column, no
        # exported value moves; a corpus re-analysed after this block was
        # added yields the identical CSV, and that is checked rather than
        # asserted (harness/batch, seven drives, CSVs byte-compared).
        #
        # THEY COUNT AS WARNINGS (S7C) for the same reason the plausibility
        # checks do: the summary's "Warnings:" line is what a user reads, and
        # a warning the summary does not count is a warning that scrolled
        # past during a four-hour run.
        #
        # UNDEFINED IS GUARDED EXPLICITLY. Measured on Praat 6.6.30,
        # 16 August 2026: on a fully unvoiced segment both queries return
        # undefined, and BOTH `undefined < 55` and `undefined > 297` evaluate
        # FALSE — so an unguarded comparison here would be silent rather than
        # wrong. The `<> undefined` is kept anyway, because relying on that is
        # relying on a detail of one build.
        #
        # THERE IS NO else BRANCH REPORTING THE UNDEFINED CASE, and that is
        # the one deliberate departure from Rule 30 in this file. An unvoiced
        # segment is ALREADY reported, once, by the mean-F0 check above; a
        # second line saying the same thing in different words would double
        # every unvoiced segment's contribution to the warning count and make
        # the summary's number mean less, not more.
        # THE WIDEST TRACK AVAILABLE IS THE ONE THAT ANSWERS, and this is the
        # second correction this block needed. Filtered autocorrelation
        # searches from 50 Hz, raw cross-correlation from 75; a track cannot
        # report a value outside its own range, so the RCC track's minimum is
        # PINNED AT 75 by construction and a guard reading it can only fire in
        # the 75-82.5 Hz sliver.
        #
        # WHAT THAT COSTS, ON THIS PROJECT'S OWN FIXTURES. harness/batch's
        # F_warn corpus carries a 60 Hz take with all six measures ticked.
        # 60 Hz is comfortably below the raw-cross-correlation floor, so its
        # jitter and shimmer come off a PointProcess built on a track that
        # could not see the voice at all — and the RCC guard reading RCC's own
        # clamped minimum said nothing, because RCC reported 75-plus like it
        # always will. The guard was silent about exactly the file it was
        # written for.
        #
        # So the representative estimate is established FIRST and the RCC
        # range is guarded against IT. FAC is preferred because APPENDIX_D §1A
        # appoints it to F0 tracking and because it is the wider window; RCC
        # answers only when it is the only track there is, and in that case
        # its own clamp is a limit this module cannot see past without
        # creating a pitch object nobody asked for. The FAC range keeps its
        # own extremes because 50 Hz is the lowest floor here, so nothing
        # wider exists to check it with.

        # stated below 300, measured 322.87, nothing flagged.
        #
        # THE MESSAGE NAMES THE DERIVED PARAMETERS, because the appendix asks
        # for exactly that — "state which parameters were derived from the
        # stated value, and let the user decide whether to re-run". A warning
        # that says only "your estimate was low" leaves the user to work out
        # what it cost.
        #
        # ONE DIRECTION, NOT TWO, and this is a judgement rather than a
        # reading of the appendix. Measured ABOVE stated is a defect: the
        # search may have been too narrow. Measured far BELOW stated is
        # ordinary — one quiet take in a corpus of sopranos — and warning on
        # it would fire on most rows of most well-configured runs, which is
        # how a warning column becomes something users filter out. An
        # overstatement only ever WIDENS these two ranges, and a range too
        # wide degrades pitch tracking gradually rather than censoring it.
        # Warning on an overstatement too would be one `elsif`, and the
        # threshold for it is a judgement this module does not make.
