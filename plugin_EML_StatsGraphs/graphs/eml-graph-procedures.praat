#
# These procedures provide consistent, publication-quality figure styling.
# Include this file at the top of any script that generates Picture window output.
#
# 
# v3.4 changes (from v3.3):
#   - @emlSetAdaptiveTheme: new .annotSize output — annotation/bracket font
#     that scales down more aggressively at small viewports (drops extra point
#     below baseUnit 3.5"). Prevents bracket text clipping at 4×4 viewports.
#   - @emlDrawViolin: added .width parameter (replaces hardcoded 0.35).
#     Enables narrower violins for grouped violin plots. boxWidth derived
#     from .width * 0.143 to maintain proportional quartile box.
#   - New primitive: @emlDrawBox — Tukey box-and-whisker with outlier dots.
#     Five-number summary + 1.5×IQR fences, clipped to axis bounds.
#   - New primitive: @emlDrawAlphaRect — alpha-composited filled rectangle
#     via PNG sprite stretching. Used for histogram overlap mode.
#     Falls back to opaque Paint rectangle: when sprites absent.
# v3.2 changes (from v3.1):
#   - @emlDrawLegend: replaced charW estimation with exact text measurement
#     via Text width (world coordinates):. All spacing (line height, padding,
#     insets, sample line length) now derived from font size in inches ×
#     world-per-inch, so physical spacing is uniform regardless of axis
#     scale ratios. Line height uses same 1.4× formula as annotation block.
#   - @emlSetColorPalette B/W sprites: reordered to grey-based (v5),
#     starting bw04 (dark-medium) + bw08 (light) for 2-group separation.
# v3.1 changes (from v3.0):
#   - @emlSetColorPalette: .line$[], .fill$[], .lightLine$[] extended from
#     6 to 10 entries in both color and B/W modes to match the 10-group cap.
#     Color mode adds Okabe-Ito yellow (7) and black (8); 9-10 cycle.
#     B/W mode adds 4 additional grey levels for groups 7-10.
#   - @emlSetAlphaDotGeometry: aspect ratio takes wuPerInchX/Y in the order
#     that keeps dots round rather than flattened into horizontal dashes.
#   - @emlDrawAlphaDot: added fileReadable guard — missing sprite file
#     falls back to native Paint circle: instead of failing silently.
# v3.0 changes (from v2.9):
#   - Alpha compositing support via PNG sprite stamping:
#     @emlInitAlphaSprites — resolves sprites/ directory, checks availability
#     @emlSetAlphaDotGeometry — aspect-corrected stamp dimensions
#     @emlDrawAlphaDot — per-point alpha dot primitive with native fallback
#   - @emlSetColorPalette: added .sprite$[1..10] arrays mapping group index
#     to sprite filename stems. Color mode uses Okabe-Ito names; B/W mode
#     uses perceptually-spaced grey levels (bw01-bw10) ordered for maximal
#     separation at any group count.
#   - Requires sprites/ folder in plugin with pre-rendered PNG dots.
#     Falls back to native Paint circle: if sprites are absent.
# v2.9 changes (from v2.8):
#   - New procedure: @emlDrawAlignedMarksRight — right-side counterpart
#     of @emlDrawAlignedMarksLeft for dual-axis panels.
# v2.7 changes (from v2.6):
#   - Headroom is the pre-dispatch valueMax expansion pattern.
#   - Near-zero tick labels (e.g., 2.776e-17) now snap to exact 0.
#     Applied to all tick loops in @emlDrawAxes, @emlDrawAxesSelective,
#     and @emlDrawAlignedMarksLeft.
#
# v2.6 changes (from v2.5):
#   - New procedure: @emlCheckNumericColumn — validates Table column
#     contains numeric data by sampling first 5 rows.
#
# v2.5 changes (from v2.4):
#   - @emlDrawAxes and @emlDrawAxesSelective now sanitize title, xLabel,
#     yLabel at entry via @emlSanitizeLabel (Rule 28J compliance).
#
# v2.4 changes (from v2.3):
#   - New procedure: @emlDrawLegend — legend box with filled background,
#     colored sample lines, and positioned text. Uses global arrays
#     legendN, legendColor$[1..N], legendLabel$[1..N].
#
# v2.3 changes (from v2.1):
#   - New procedures: @emlSanitizeLabel, @emlDrawJitteredPoints,
#     @emlAssertFullViewport, @emlCheckChannels
#
# v2.1 changes:
#   - @emlDrawViolin now accepts axisYMin/axisYMax for clipping to axis bounds
#   - @emlSetAdaptiveTheme: wider marginLeft for y-axis label accommodation
#
# v2.0 changes:
#   - Gridlines now align with axis ticks (shared nice-number computation)
#   - Minor gridlines (ticks + lines, no numbers) at medium/large sizes
#   - Size-adaptive tick density prevents label collision at small viewports
#   - Compressed margins at very small viewports

# PANEL ORIGIN AND EXTENT TRACKING
# ============================================================================

# by these values.
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PAGE COMPOSITION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# emlEraseFirst — 1 clears the Picture window before a panel is drawn and
# starts the extent union again from that panel; 0 leaves whatever is on the
# page and adds to the union. 1 is the default everywhere, and it is the
# behaviour a single figure has always had.
#
# THE PAGE IS COMPUTED, NEVER DECLARED. There is no page width, no page
# height and no grid: each panel keeps its own (width, height), and the page
# rectangle is the extent union @emlExpandDrawnExtent maintains, which is
# already what @emlAssertFullViewport hands to Save. So a composite is saved
# by the machinery that saves a single figure, and an early save of a
# half-built page is simply a smaller image.
#
# emlPagePanelN — how many panels are on the page the union describes. Reset
# to 1 by an erasing panel, incremented by a composing one. It is a
# DESCRIPTION of the page rather than a layout decision: nothing reads it to
# place anything. The Save panel reads it to decide whether to call what it
# is about to write a figure or a page.
emlEraseFirst = 1
emlPagePanelN = 0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlSetPanelOrigin
# Sets the origin for the current drawing panel. All subsequent calls to
# @emlSetAdaptiveTheme will offset viewport bounds by this origin.
# For single-panel figures, do not call (defaults are 0, 0).
# For multi-panel, call before each panel's draw procedure.
# Arguments: .x (inches from left), .y (inches from top)

# @emlBeginPanel: .originX, .originY, .erase
# OPEN A PANEL ON THE PAGE. The one place that decides whether a draw starts a
# fresh page or adds to the one already there.
#
# .erase = 1  clear the Picture window, restart the extent union, and count
#             this panel as the first on a new page.
# .erase = 0  leave the page alone, keep the union, and count this panel as
#             another one on the page already there.
#
# THE ERASE AND THE UNION MOVE TOGETHER, and that is the whole of the
# mechanism. @emlAssertFullViewport saves the union, so a union that survived
# an erase would save a rectangle larger than the ink -- and a union reset
# without an erase would save the last panel and crop the rest of the page
# off. One procedure, one decision, so the two cannot drift apart.
#
# THE ORIGIN IS TYPED INCHES, not a grid and not a slot. It is applied here
# through @emlSetPanelOrigin, which every @emlSetAdaptiveTheme call already
# reads, so a panel drawn at (6.5, 0) reports its rectangle at (6.5, 0) to the
# union as well as drawing there. Erase with an offset origin is valid: it
# clears the page and starts a composite whose first panel is not at 0, 0.
#
# CALLERS. graphs/eml-graphs-form.praat calls this once per press of Draw,
# from @emlGraphsDispatchDraw, with the values from the draw dialog's
# "Erase page first" and "Panel origin" fields. A recorded workflow calls it
# with the values the block at the top of the emitted script declares. A
# standalone script that never calls it gets @emlInitializeDrawingDefaults' erase-on
# single panel at the origin, which is what such a script has always had.

# the appendix fixes. Very accurate ON changes voiced edge coverage, which
# moves a short token's mean by about a hertz -- a difference between two
# doors onto the same sound, which is the kind of thing a reader cannot see

    ; 2.92% narrower and 2.59% shorter, inside its own gridlines.

    # COLOUR IS THE PALETTE'S AND STYLE IS THE SERIES'. Ruled by Ian on
    # 18 August 2026, and it supersedes BOTH earlier rules -- the one under
    # which the right series picked a colour of its own, and the one written
    # in this block before him, under which the two series shared one ink.
    # The ruling is what the palette machinery already does:
    #
    #   * The FIRST series selects the THEME -- that is the existing colour
    #     mode, colour or black-and-white. There is no new colour control and
    #     no per-series colour picker.
    #   * The SECOND series takes SLOT TWO of that theme. Measured:
    #     @emlSetColorPalette declares eight ordered slots, Okabe-Ito in
    #     colour and a grey ramp in black-and-white, and
    #     @emlOptimizePaletteContrast re-spreads them for the number of series
    #     actually drawn. At two it gives blue and orange in colour, and in
    #     black-and-white its own comment says "a two-group figure gets the
    #     extreme ends" -- maximally contrasting by construction. So a
    #     two-series figure calls the palette with the chosen mode, runs the
    #     optimiser with two, and takes slots one and two. NO NEW COLOUR LOGIC
    #     IS WRITTEN HERE; a colour literal in this feature is a wrong turn.
    #   * EACH series carries its OWN line style, and style is what
    #     distinguishes them, because the field's journals still print in
    #     grayscale and a pair separated only by hue arrives at the reader as
    #     two identical lines. Style survives the photocopier; colour does not.
    #
    # A GROUPED PRIMARY IS THE SAME RULE, GENERALISED AND NOT EXCEPTED. The
    # primary may itself be several groups, and the optimiser is then called
    # with nGroups + 1 and the right series takes the LAST slot -- which at
    # the ungrouped case is exactly slot two of two, the ruling verbatim.
    #
    # THE DEFAULTS ARE SOLID THEN DASHED, and both are overridable: the first
    # series from a "Line style" menu on its own dialog, the second from the
    # follow-up pause that asks for everything else the right axis needs.
    emlSecondAxisOn = 0
    # WHAT THE SERIES MEAN. Empty is "nobody said", which is what a caller
    # with no graphs form is: the right-hand axis is judged on the type alone
    # for such a caller, exactly as it was before the question tree existed.

    # THE RIGHT MARGIN'S INK IS NOT OURS TO CHOOSE, AND THAT IS MEASURED.
    # Ian left one thing open: whether the right-hand axis FURNITURE -- its
    # ticks, its numbers and its name -- should take slot two's colour or stay
    # default ink. Praat 6.6.30 settles it. Its margin commands IGNORE the
    # current colour and draw in black:
    #
    #     Colour: "Red"
    #     One mark right: 50, "yes", "yes", "no", ""     -> black
    #     Marks right every: 1, 25, "yes", "yes", "no"   -> black
    #     Text right: "yes", "name"                      -> black
    #
    # and the left and bottom margins behave identically, which is why the
    # `Colour:` call at the top of @emlDrawAlignedMarksLeft has never coloured
    # anything either. Every one of those was driven, in isolation, and the
    # ink was read back off the rendered pixels -- see
    # harness/secondaxis/margin_ink.praat, which is that probe kept.
    #
    # So there is no colour hook here. Colouring the right margin would mean
    # drawing the right margin ourselves -- ticks as `Draw line` and numbers
    # as `Text` in a viewport widened past the plot -- which is the new
    # drawing machinery this change order was told not to build. If Ian rules
    # for coloured furniture, that is what it will cost, and it is a change
    # order of its own.
    #
    # WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE TWO SERIES IS THEREFORE THE SERIES THEMSELVES:

# Populates colour AND FILL-PATTERN arrays for data series.
#
# THE STYLE SPACE IS TWO-DIMENSIONAL.
#
# There are EIGHT hues, not ten. Ten declared fill/line pairs whose slots 9
# and 10 duplicate 1 and 2 draw two pairs of sub-groups in INDISTINGUISHABLE
# colours, on the figure and in the legend, with nothing said about it -- and
# the cycling rule above ten is `mod 8`, which is the giveaway. The answer is
# not a ceiling of eight. It is a second dimension the eye reads
# independently of hue:
#
#     8 hues  x  3 fill patterns  =  24 distinguishable sub-group styles
#
# ORDERING -- HUE CYCLES FIRST:
#     index   1..8    the eight hues, SOLID
#     index   9..16   the same eight hues, DIAGONAL HATCH
#     index  17..24   the same eight hues, DOTTED
#
#     hue     = ((index - 1) mod 8) + 1
#     pattern = (((index - 1) div 8) mod 3) + 1      1 solid, 2 hatch, 3 dots
#
# Hue-first is deliberate. Sub-groups take consecutive indices, so ADJACENT
# sub-groups differ in hue -- the stronger cue -- and the weaker cue (pattern)
# only ever has to separate marks that are eight apart. Pattern-first would
# have put three near-identical blues next to each other.
#
# Above 24 the pair (hue, pattern) repeats. That is the ceiling
# @emlDrawGroupedViolin and @emlDrawGroupedBoxPlot hold at 24 and disclose;
# it is not raised silently anywhere.
#
# Arguments: mode$ ("color" or "bw")
#
# Outputs:
#   .line$[1..100]      stroke colour        (hue only -- repeats every 8)
#   .fill$[1..100]      body fill colour     (hue only -- repeats every 8)
#   .lightLine$[1..100] 50% blend to white   (hue only -- repeats every 8)
#   .sprite$[1..100]    alpha sprite stem    (hue only -- repeats every 8)
#   .pattern[1..100]    1 solid | 2 diagonal hatch | 3 dots   (AREA marks)
#   .marker[1..100]     1 circle | 2 square | 3 triangle      (POINT marks)
#   .hue[1..100]        which of the eight hues this index carries
#   .nHues = 8, .nPatterns = 3, .nMarkers = 3, .nStyles = 24
#
# TWO SECOND DIMENSIONS, ONE INDEX.
#
# .pattern is a FILL pattern and needs an area to live in. A scatter dot, a
# spaghetti endpoint and a line-chart vertex have no area to fill, so for
# those four chart types the second dimension is the marker SHAPE. It is the
# same arithmetic on the same index, so slot i is "hue h, style band b" for
# both families and the cap is 24 for both:
#
#     .pattern[i] = .marker[i] = (((i - 1) div 8) mod 3) + 1
#
# The two are separate arrays anyway, deliberately: they are read by
# different procedures, a consumer that wants one and gets the other is a
# bug, and naming the shape "pattern" would have hidden it.
#
# NOTE THE ASYMMETRY. .line$[9] and .fill$[9] are IDENTICAL to index 1 by
# construction, and .pattern is what differs, so the drawn mark differs. But
# it does mean that any consumer that reads .line$/.fill$ and IGNORES
# .pattern draws two sub-groups the same way. That is why @emlDrawLegend
# reads the pattern too.
#
# Note: For API users who need custom colours, set .line$[n], .fill$[n],
# .lightLine$[n] and .pattern[n] directly after calling this procedure.

# FILL PATTERNS
# ============================================================================
# Praat has no native pattern fill. What works, and renders cleanly at
# 300 dpi, is to paint the shape solid and then draw the pattern OVER it,
# clipped to the shape by arithmetic the caller is already doing:
#
#   @emlDrawViolin already paints the body as a stack of ~500 thin horizontal
#   Paint rectangle slices, each with a known centre and half-width. For any
#   scanline the left and right extent of the body are therefore already in
#   hand, and a diagonal stripe clipped to that scanline is one subtraction.
#   @emlDrawBox is a rectangle, which is the same thing with a constant
#   half-width. NO GENERAL POLYGON CLIP IS COMPUTED ANYWHERE.
#
# Pattern codes, matching emlSetColorPalette.pattern[]:
#   1  solid            nothing drawn over the fill
#   2  diagonal hatch   45 degrees on the page, up to the right
#   3  dots             hexagonally packed, each dot drawn only where the
#                       WHOLE dot fits inside the shape, so no dot is ever
#                       chopped in half at the outline
#
# Anything other than 2 or 3 is treated as solid, so an uninitialised or
# out-of-range pattern degrades to today's behaviour rather than to an error.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlSetPatternScale
# Records the world-units-per-inch of the CURRENTLY INSTALLED axes, so that
# the pattern primitives can lay out a hatch at 45 degrees ON THE PAGE and a
# dot grid that is round on the page, rather than at whatever angle the ratio
# of the two axis ranges happens to imply.
#
# Call once, immediately after `Axes:`, in any procedure that will draw a
# patterned mark. @emlDrawViolin and @emlDrawBox fall back to an assumed
# geometry when it has never been called, so an API caller that forgets gets
# a slightly-off hatch angle, not a wrong figure.
#
# IT ALSO PUBLISHES THE FRAME ITSELF. The four numbers handed in here ARE
# the plotting frame -- they are what was just passed to `Axes:` -- and
# without them recorded no primitive can tell a point inside the box from a
# point beyond it. Praat does not clip: `Paint circle` at x = 322 on an axis
# that stops at 300 draws a dot in
# the MARGIN, on top of the tick labels, at a horizontal position that
# corresponds to no value on the axis. A reader has no way to know it is not
# data. Publishing the frame here is what lets @emlDrawMarker and
# @emlDrawAlphaDot refuse it; see @emlPointInFrame.
#
# Every procedure that draws point markers already calls this immediately
# after its own `Axes:`, which is why the frame is always the current one at
# the moment a marker is placed. A caller that never calls it leaves
# emlFrameKnown at 0 and nothing clips.

#   .inside  1 = draw it, 0 = it is outside the frame the user asked for
#
# WHY. A user who types an axis range is
# choosing what the figure is about. Praat's drawing primitives take that as
# a coordinate transform and nothing more: a point beyond the range is
# converted to a page position beyond the box and painted there. Measured on
# a 30-row scatter with x typed as 100-300 against data running 90-322
# (harness/graphaxes/cases/repro_scatter_clip.praat): one dot sat on the "100"
# tick label and three sat in the right margin outside the box entirely, each
# at a page position that decodes to a value the axis does not contain.
#
# THIS DOES NOT CHANGE A SINGLE COMPUTED NUMBER, and that distinction is the
# whole of the design. The correlation, the regression, the n and the CSV are
# computed from every valid row and go on being computed from every valid
# row; a range is a VIEWPORT, not a filter, and a figure that quietly
# recomputed its statistics over the visible subset would be a far worse
# defect than a dot in the margin. What this decides is only whether ink is
# put down outside the box. The count of points withheld is tracked in
# emlClippedN so the caller can say so on the figure rather than let a reader
# assume the frame holds everything.

# THE INK. White-on-fill is what the prototype used, and it fails on this
# palette: every colour fill is a 70% blend toward white, so a white hatch on
# "{0.99, 0.97, 0.78}" (pale yellow) is very nearly invisible, and the same
# is true of the light end of the grey ramp. The pattern is therefore drawn
# in the mark's own stroke colour -- which is the SAME hue, so the pattern
# cannot be mistaken for a different sub-group -- except on fills dark enough
# that a dark stroke would disappear into them, where it flips.
#
# The rule lives in @emlMarkInk, which the mark's OUTLINE, median and
# whiskers use as well, so a mark is drawn in exactly one ink throughout
# rather than as a hatch that flips and an outline that does not. See there
# for why the test is per-channel rather than on the red channel alone.

# @emlMarkInk
# The colour a mark's own detail is drawn in: outline, median, whiskers, and
# the hatch or dot pattern. Normally that is the mark's stroke colour -- same
# hue as the fill, so the detail can never be mistaken for a different
# sub-group. When the stroke does not separate from the fill it flips to
# white (on a dark fill) or black (on a light one).
#
# PER CHANNEL, not on the red channel and not on a luminance conversion.
# Okabe-Ito yellow is fill {0.99, 0.97, 0.78} against stroke
# {0.95, 0.90, 0.25}: the red channels are FOUR HUNDREDTHS apart and the blue
# channels are 0.53 apart. A red-channel test (which is what @emlPatternSetup
# used before v1.24, and which was correct while every fill was a pastel or a
# grey) declares yellow unreadable and paints its hatch black -- a visible
# regression, and one that would have been introduced by this very change.
# Rec.601 luminance makes the same mistake for the same reason: it weights
# blue at 0.114. The channel that actually carries the contrast decides.
#
# THRESHOLD 0.235. Below about a quarter a 0.5 pt outline and a 0.4 pt hatch
# stripe stop reading at 300 dpi. On the v1.24 greyscale ramp the fill/stroke
# separation runs 0.31, 0.28, 0.25, 0.22, 0.19, 0.16, 0.13, 0.10 down the
# eight slots, so slots 1-3 keep their grey stroke and slots 4-8 flip --
# slot 4 to black (its fill is 0.58, light), slots 5-8 to white. No pair in
# the colour palette is closer than 0.37 on its best channel, so NO COLOUR
# FILL EVER FLIPS; the colour figures this repo already ships are unchanged.
#
# The odd-looking 0.235 is deliberate: it sits halfway between the two ramp
# separations it has to separate, 0.22 and 0.25. A round 0.25 lands ON one of
# them, and "0.70 - 0.45 < 0.25" is TRUE in IEEE doubles (0.24999999999999997)
# and false in decimal, so slot 3 flipped or did not flip depending on how
# the ramp happened to be rounded. Measured that way once, on the render:
# slot 11's hatch came out black instead of the 0.45 grey the ramp asks for.

#                       the stroke returns it unchanged, because white on a

# SCREEN-DOOR TRANSPARENCY — THE ALPHA BACKGROUND WITHOUT ALPHA
# ============================================================================
# An on-figure box (the legend panel, the annotation block) is supposed to sit
# on a SEMI-TRANSPARENT white ground, so that the box can be read without the
# data under it being deleted. The plugin gets that from sprites/
# bg_white_a70_40.png, a 40 x 40 PNG whose every pixel is RGBA
# (255, 255, 255, 179). MEASURED, not read off the filename: 179/255 = 0.702,
# so the sprite is a 70.2% white wash and the data under it survives at 29.8%
# of its contrast.
#
# @emlInitAlphaSprites refuses to hand that sprite out anywhere except macOS
# and Windows, and the refusal is correct: Praat's Graphics_imageFromFile has
# a GDI+ branch and a Quartz branch and no cairo branch, so on Linux
# `Insert picture from file:` computes its coordinates and draws NOTHING. No
# error, no return code. Confirmed here 9 Aug 2026 by rendering the same
# script with and without the call: `compare -metric AE` scores the two PNGs
# BYTE-IDENTICAL.
#
# THE ONLY OTHER NATIVE FALLBACK IS `Paint rectangle: "White"` — an OPAQUE
# box. Same code, same figure, and a mac reader sees a violin through the
# legend where a Linux reader sees a white hole. That is the gap this section
# closes.
#
# WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD. Screen-door transparency: a fine white LATTICE, bars
# in both axes at a fixed pitch on the page, with square holes between them.
# Ink covers about 70% of the box and the holes leave the other 30% showing
# the data untouched. At 300 dpi the cell is 8 pixels, which reads as a wash
# rather than as a plaid, and no datum under the box is erased — it is
# sampled.
#
# WHY A LATTICE AND NOT A 45-DEGREE HATCH OR A DOT FIELD. @emlPaintHatchRow's
# construction with the roles reversed (white stripes at 45 degrees, thin
# gaps) is the obvious candidate -- it is the pattern engine this file already
# has, and a 45-degree screen is what a printer would use. It was built and
# MEASURED, and it fails here for two independent reasons:
#
#   1. PRAAT DOES NOT ANTIALIAS AND IT ROUNDS OUTWARD. Measured 9 Aug 2026 by
#      painting 25 rectangles of known sub-pixel width: every rendered pixel
#      is pure black or pure white (zero intermediate values over the whole
#      test), and the painted width is the asked-for width plus about one
#      device pixel. A hatch decomposed into 0.004-inch scanlines is a stack
#      of rectangles ~1.2 pixels tall, every one of them fattened by a pixel
#      in BOTH axes, and the screen closes up: measured coverage 0.94 against
#      an asked-for 0.70. A screen that collapses to solid is worse than no
#      screen at all.
#   2. It costs 140x more primitives for the same box (0.281 s against
#      0.002 s on a 0.7 x 0.6 inch patch), because a diagonal has to be
#      sliced and an axis-aligned lattice does not.
#
#      A hex DOT field fails on the same arithmetic from the other side. At
#      70% coverage the holes are the minority, so a field of white dots has
#      to nearly touch: the gap between neighbours is 0.12 of the pitch, which
#      is under one pixel at any pitch fine enough to read as a wash.
#
# The lattice is the same idea as those two — a periodic pattern clipped to a
# rectangle, phase-locked to the rectangle's own corner, scaled through
# emlPatWorldPerInchX/Y so the geometry is stated in INCHES ON THE PAGE and is
# the same at every figure size, exactly as @emlPatternSetup states the hatch
# pitch in inches. It just does not need slicing, because both bar families
# are axis-parallel and each is a single `Paint rectangle`.
#
# THE GEOMETRY, AND WHY THESE NUMBERS.
#
#   pitch  0.027 inch. @emlPatternSetup already states what a periodic
#          pattern may measure: below ~0.022 inch the stripes
#          merge into a tint at 300 dpi, and above ~0.075 inch a single wide
#          mark shows only one or two. 0.027 is just inside the fine end of that
#          band — 8.1 pixels at 300 dpi, 16.2 at 600.
#   bar    the geometric answer, LESS A KERF. A lattice of bars covering
#          fraction f of the pitch on each axis covers 1 - (1 - f)^2 of the
#          area, so 0.702 coverage wants f = 0.454. Praat then paints every
#          bar about one device pixel wider than asked (finding 1 above), so
#          the bar is specified 0.0023 inch — 0.7 pixel at 300 dpi — thinner
#          than that, and comes out right.
#
# MEASURED, on rendered pixels, three box phases x two resolutions:
#
#          asked   300 dpi   600 dpi        sprite, for comparison
#   ink     0.702    0.740     0.672         0.702
#   holes      —     0.260     0.328         0.298
#
# Both within 0.04 of the sprite, and the 0.34-0.40 bar-fraction plateau
# either side of the chosen 0.37 renders the SAME two numbers, so the setting
# is not balanced on a rounding edge. Vector output (PDF/EPS) has no pixel
# grid and no kerf, so the screen there is the nominal 0.60 — lighter than the
# sprite, which is the safe direction: more data survives, not less.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not touch the sprite path. On macOS and Windows
# @emlPaintAlphaBox issues the `Insert picture from file:` and nothing below
# runs.

#
# THE DRAWN RANGE FOR AN AXIS THAT TAKES ITS BOUNDS FROM THE DATA ITSELF.
#
# A time axis is not rounded to nice numbers the way a value axis is -- a
# recording that runs 0 to 1.37 seconds runs to 1.37, and a reader expects the
# last sample to be at the right-hand end. But bounds set exactly to the data
# put the first and last markers ON the frame, so half of each marker hangs
# outside the plot: measured at 15 pixels of a 30-pixel marker at 300 dpi,
# 1.16% of the plotted width, on every line chart this plugin draws.
#
# BASE R PADS, AND BY HOW MUCH IS MEASURED RATHER THAN QUOTED. On R 4.3.3,
# data 0..9 with the default xaxs returns par("usr") of -0.36 .. 9.36: exactly
# 0.04 of the span at each end, on both axes. xaxs="i" gives the flush range,
# which is the exception a user asks for. This procedure is the default.
#
# NO NICE-NUMBER ROUNDING, for the reason the call sites already state: a time
# axis is not rounded. Base R does not round either -- it returned -0.36 and
# not -0.5.
#
# NO CLAMP AT ZERO. @emlComputeAxisRange clamps non-negative data so a value
# axis cannot dip below 0; base R does not, and a frame reaching t = -0.04 is
# not a claim that t = -0.04 was observed. The first tick LABEL is still 0:
# @emlDrawAlignedMarksBottom starts at the first nice multiple at or above the
# minimum, so the padding widens the frame without adding a label.
#
# THE ZERO-SPAN GUARD CLOSES A LIVE ABORT. A table whose time column holds one
# repeated value gives .dataMin = .dataMax, and Praat's `Axes:` refuses it --
# "Error: Left and right should not be equal", the figure abandoned mid-draw.
# Reproduced on both callers before this procedure existed. The fallback span
# is the one @emlComputeAxisRange already uses for the same situation on the
# value axis, so the two resolvers degenerate the same way, and the pad is
# half of it so the single point sits in the middle of the frame.

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `One mark left: 200.05, "yes", ...` does not print 200.05.
# It prints "200.1". `One mark left: 200.01` prints "200". Praat's automatic
# mark number carries FOUR SIGNIFICANT DIGITS and rounds -- sometimes
# mis-rounds -- everything past them away. Measured on 6.6.30, 15 Aug 2026,
# harness/graphaxes/out/markprobe.png: six marks at 200.1, 200.05, 200.01,
# 200.005, 199.95 and 199.4 came out as "200.1", "200.1", "200", "200",
# "199.9", "199.4". Two pairs of distinct heights carry one label between
# them, and 199.95 is labelled 199.9, which is not a rounding a reader can
# undo.
#
# It is invisible at ordinary scales because four significant digits is
# plenty for an axis running 0 to 100, or 75 to 500. It bites when the axis
# is NARROW AND FAR FROM ZERO -- which is exactly a sustained note: a singer
# holding 200 Hz produces a pitch track spanning a hundredth of a hertz, and
# every tick on it reads "200". The figure then shows a wildly fluctuating
# contour against six identical numbers, and there is nothing on the page to
# tell a reader that the whole vertical extent is one part in ten thousand.
# The other half of the answer is the minimum span in @emlDrawF0Contour.
#
# THE RULE. Digits needed = digits left of the point at the far end of the
# axis, plus the decimals the STEP needs to distinguish one tick from the
# next. When that total is within Praat's four, this procedure returns
# .explicit = 0 and the caller passes "" so that Praat formats the mark. Only
# when the total exceeds four does the plugin take over the formatting, and
# then it writes the decimals the step actually needs.
#
# .decimals IS CAPPED AT 6. Past that the label is longer than the tick
# spacing can carry and the axis is unreadable for a different reason; a
# figure needing more than six decimals of tick label is a figure whose axis
# range is wrong, and @emlDrawF0Contour's minimum span is what prevents it.

    ;   because the exponent carries the magnitude and the mantissa is short.
    ;   Writing those out with fixed$ gives "0.000000001", which is not a
    ;   correction, it is a worse label.
    ;
    ;   .decimals > 0 -- A STEP OF A WHOLE UNIT OR MORE CANNOT COLLIDE. On

# which is the rule @emlTickPrecision's header documents and which was
# measured on 6.6.30 -- 200.05 prints "200.1", 200.01 prints "200", 100.10
# prints "100.1", -32.98 prints "-32.98".
#
# THE WINDOW, AND WHY IT IS NARROW ON PURPOSE. Praat switches to exponent
# notation outside roughly 0.001 <= |v| < 10000, and it was measured doing so:
# at 300 dpi and 10 pt, 9999 renders 7.54 mm wide and 10000 renders 4.91 mm --
# "10^4", not "10000". Modelling that switch is guesswork, and a wrong guess
# would not be a harmless over-estimate: an axis running to 1e9 would be
# predicted as ten digits, would trigger the axis-name shift below, and would
# MOVE A FIGURE THAT IS DRAWN CORRECTLY TODAY (violin_hugevalues in
# harness/stress_cases is exactly that figure). Outside the window this
# procedure therefore returns nothing at all and the caller does nothing --
# the conservative direction, because the failure it exists to prevent is a
# collision and the failure it must not cause is a figure that moves.
#
# Requires: the ambient font and size are the ones the marks are drawn at.

# BEST_PRACTICES_DRAWING's font invariant already requires be held constant

# Draw the y-axis NAME in the left margin without letting the tick numbers
# run into it.
#
# THE REQUIREMENT IS NO COLLISION BETWEEN THE Y-AXIS NAME AND ITS TICK
# LABELS.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC. Praat's left-margin allocation is FIXED. `Text
# left` puts the rotated axis name at a distance from the inner frame that
# depends on the font SIZE and on nothing else -- measured at 300 dpi on
# 6.6.30: the name's right edge sits 13.4 px per point of font size from the
# frame (94 px at 7 pt, 134 at 10, 147 at 11), and it sits there whether the
# ticks read "5" or "-32.98". Measured again in Helvetica, Times and Courier
# at two sizes: 134 px at 10 pt in all three, so the allocation is a function
# of size alone and not of the font's own metrics. Tick numbers are
# right-aligned to the frame, their right edge 1.8 px per point inside it,
# and they grow LEFTWARD into that fixed band as they get longer. About five
# characters fit. Six is the failure edge:
#
#   a semitone axis with negatives, F0 (semitones re 440 Hz) against "-33.08"
#     -- 3 px of gap at 300 dpi, a quarter of a millimetre
#   an explicit two-decimal dB axis, Power (dB) against "100.10"
#     -- 4 px, and it reads as "Powe100.10"
#
# There is no truncation and no overprint. The mode is gap exhaustion.
#
# WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS FIX. Widening the plugin's own left margin does NOT
# work, and this was measured rather than reasoned: the same figure drawn at
# marginLeft 0.84" and 1.10" puts the name, the ticks and the frame in exactly
# the same relative positions, 3 px of gap in both, because everything in the
# margin is anchored to the inner frame and the frame moves with the margin.
# A wider margin buys white space on the far left and not one pixel of gap.
#
# THE MECHANISM. The name is drawn by Praat, from Praat's own anchor, into a
# frame that is momentarily declared to start further left. `Select inner
# viewport` with the left edge moved out by .shiftInch, `Axes` re-issued
# unchanged, `Text left`, then both restored -- so the name lands exactly
# where Praat would have put it for a figure whose plot began there, at the
# same vertical centre, the same rotation, the same size, and nothing else in
# the figure has been told anything. The alternative -- placing the name with
# `Text special` at a computed inch coordinate, as @emlDrawTitle does -- was
# rejected because it would replace Praat's vertical centring and baseline
# rule with a reimplementation of them, and every figure in the plugin would
# then depend on that reimplementation being right.
#
# THE SHIFT IS ZERO ON AN ORDINARY FIGURE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Widening
# the margin unconditionally would also satisfy "no collision", while moving
# every figure the plugin draws. .wideLabelMM is 0 unless some tick label is
# SIX CHARACTERS OR MORE, so a figure whose ticks read "45" or "200.2" takes
# the else branch below, which is a bare `Text left`. Verified by rendering
# all 39 figures of harness/stress_graphs.sh.
#
# THE ARITHMETIC. .allowMM is the room between the tick numbers' right edge
# and the name's right edge, from the two measured constants above:
# (13.4 - 1.8) px/pt = 11.6 px/pt = 0.982 mm per point of font size. The
# clearance restored is one character width of the current font.
#
# THE SHIFT IS CLAMPED TO THE ROOM THE PANEL HAS, and the clamp is the reason
# this procedure changes no figure's SIZE. Praat saves the outer viewport that
# @emlAssertFullViewport selects, and it saves nothing outside it: measured
# by drawing an axis name at 0.4" and saving from 0.5", which cut
# the name and dropped a fifth of the figure's ink. So a name pushed past the
# panel's own left edge would be sliced down its length on export unless the
# saved box grew -- and growing it is how a 6 x 4 request becomes a file that
# is not 6 x 4, which validate/v32 keeps a pinned inventory of on purpose.
# Layout is this procedure's business; the size of the user's file is not.
#
# WHAT THE CLAMP COSTS, SAID PLAINLY. On every figure this plugin's own form
# draws -- 6 x 4 at 9.36 pt -- the room is 0.29" and the shift needed is a
# tenth of that, so the clamp never engages and the collision is fully
# relieved. It engages only on a panel small enough that the axis name has
# less than its own thickness of room inside the panel: a 3 x 2 panel at 7 pt

# that spelling is refused with "Command not available for current

# left set does not merely dash the next series -- it dashes the next TICK
# MARK, the next inner box and the next bracket, on this figure and on every
# figure drawn after it in the same session. So a stroke that sets a style
# resets it, and @emlResetLineStyle is called at the end of every draw

# THE RIGHT AXIS'S RANGE, AND THE ONE HEADROOM NEGOTIATION BOTH SERIES ARE IN.
#
# THE TYPED CASE IS THE EASY HALF: a pair the user typed is the range, exactly
# as on the left, and (0, 0) is the auto sentinel every dialog in this plugin
# names on its own face.
#
# THE AUTO CASE IS WHERE THE TWO SERIES MEET. The second series ADOPTS the
# inner rectangle the first one built -- same plot box, not same world -- so
# the question is not "what is a nice range for this column" but "where in
# THIS box should this column sit". The left series answered that already: its
# data occupies some fraction of the box, and everything above and below it is
# headroom the figure negotiated once -- for the nice-number rounding, for a
# legend, for an annotation bracket. The right series is placed at THE SAME
# FRACTIONS, so whatever room the figure made, both series made it together
# and neither can end up jammed under a legend the other one moved.
#
# It also means the two series cannot be made to cross by an accident of
# scaling: a rising left series and a rising right series rise together, which
# is what a reader of a dual-scale figure is entitled to assume.
#
# NICE NUMBERS ARE NOT APPLIED TO THE RANGE, and that is not an omission.
# @emlDrawAlignedMarksRight puts its ticks at multiples of a nice STEP inside
# whatever range it is given, so the numbers in the right margin are round
# whether or not the ends of the axis are -- and rounding the ends here would
# add a second helping of headroom on top of the one just inherited.
#
# DEGENERATE INPUTS FALL BACK RATHER THAN ABORT: a left axis of zero height, a
# left series that fills its box exactly, or a right column with one distinct
# value each end in a range that is merely padded. A figure with an odd axis
# is a figure; an undefined bound handed to `Axes:` is not.

# else: it turns `SPL_dB` into `SPL dB` (unit not parenthesised, Rule 28C
# unmet), and a column whose unit is written in lower case loses its casing
# the moment a caller title-cases the result. The tables below are the whole
# heuristic:
# adding a unit is a one-line edit to emlLabelUnitMap$, adding an acronym a
# one-line edit to emlLabelAcronymMap$. No chain of ifs.
#
# Format: "|<lowercased token>:<canonical form>|" — the leading and trailing
# bars are load-bearing, @emlLookupLabelToken searches for "|token:".
#
# UNIT tokens are, in addition, lifted into a trailing parenthesis when they
# are the LAST underscore-separated token of a multi-token name:
#   F0_Hz        → F0 (Hz)
#   SPL_dB       → SPL (dB)
#   jitter_pct   → Jitter (%)
# ACRONYM tokens are only case-corrected; they name a quantity, not a unit,
# so they are never parenthesised:
#   mean_spl     → Mean SPL
#   f0_sd        → F0 SD
# Anything unrecognised falls through to plain Rule 28B.

# ============================================================================
# POINT MARKERS
# ============================================================================
# The second dimension for the four chart types that draw dots and lines --
# scatter, line chart, spaghetti, time series: a square and a triangle
# alongside the circle.
#
# THEY ARE NOT SPRITES. Three reasons, in order:
#
#   1. The .sprite$[] array that @emlSetColorPalette carries is READ in
#      exactly two places, @emlDrawAlphaDot and @emlDrawAlphaRect, and both
#      are gated on emlInitAlphaSprites.available. plugin/sprites/ is real --
#      204 tracked PNGs, 168 dots, 34 rectangles, 2 backgrounds, including
#      dot_blue_a50_40.png, the file @emlInitAlphaSprites probes for -- so the
#      array is live on macOS and on Windows.
#
#      It is nonetheless useless for THIS job, for two independent reasons.
#      First, every sprite in the set is a DOT or a RECTANGLE: the array
#      indexes HUE, one stem per colour, and there is no shape axis in it at
#      all. Adding one means 168 more files for squares and 168 for triangles,
#      at every alpha level and every size, to express what two lines of
#      arithmetic express. Second, @emlInitAlphaSprites returns early on
#      anything that is not macOS or Windows, because Praat's
#      Graphics_imageFromFile has a GDI+ branch and a Quartz branch and NO
#      cairo branch -- on Linux it computes its coordinates and draws nothing,
#      with no error and no return code. A raster marker would therefore
#      render as a BLANK on the platform this harness measures, which is
#      exactly what the gate exists to stop.
#
#   2. Praat has no filled-polygon primitive to lean on either (the Polygon
#      OBJECT has "Draw (closed)", an outline, and creating and removing an
#      object per dot inside a draw loop that is already juggling Table
#      selections is not something to do). A triangle is therefore painted as
#      a stack of horizontal `Paint rectangle` slices -- the same construction
#      @emlDrawViolin uses for its body, and the same one @emlPaintHatchRow
#      uses for a stripe. Nothing new is being invented here.
#
#   3. Native drawing scales with the figure and a 40-pixel PNG does not. The
#      plugin renders anything from a 3-inch panel to a 20-inch one at 300 dpi;
#      a stamped raster is soft at the top of that range and no smaller file
#      helps at the bottom.
#
# So: native primitives, no generated assets. If Praat ever gains a cairo
# image branch that changes the calculus for ALPHA, not for shape.
#
# GEOMETRY, at the plugin's real dot sizes. `.halfIn` is the marker's radius
# in INCHES -- the circle's radius, and the reference the other two shapes are
# sized against. On a 6 x 4 inch figure @emlSetAdaptiveTheme.markerSize is
# 1.0 and @emlDrawScatterPlot's three dot sizes give .halfIn = 0.035, 0.065
# and 0.108 inches, i.e. 21, 39 and 65 pixels ACROSS at 300 dpi. Spaghetti
# and time-series markers are set in millimetres and land at 1.5 mm and
# 1.4 mm radius, about 35 and 33 pixels across. A triangle is legible from
# roughly 8 pixels across, so every one of those has room to spare; the
# measured floor is in validate/v29_figure_disclosure.R.
#
#   1 circle    radius .halfIn.                        area  3.142 halfIn^2
#   2 square    half-side 0.8862 * .halfIn.            area  3.142 halfIn^2
#   3 triangle  equilateral, circumradius 1.45*.halfIn,
#               apex up, base flat.                    area  2.731 halfIn^2
#
# The square is sized for EQUAL AREA with the circle so the two carry the
# same visual weight. An equal-area triangle would need circumradius
# 1.5551 * .halfIn and a bounding box 2.69 x 2.33 times the circle's radius,
# which crowds a dense scatter; 1.45 gives it 87% of the circle's ink in a
# 2.51 x 2.18 box, which reads as the same weight without spreading further.

# Escapes Praat text-rendering special characters (%, #, ^, _) so they

# Also converts underscores to spaces for display-friendly labels.
# Arguments: raw$ (the raw string, e.g., a column name or user input)
# Outputs: .result$ (the sanitized string safe for Text: commands)
#
# NOTE: Call this on ANY string that will be passed to Text:, Text left:,
# Text bottom:, Text top:, or One mark: commands — unless you intentionally
# want style formatting.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IT IS IDEMPOTENT, AND IT HAS TO BE. A naive escaper destroys the character
# it is protecting when it runs twice:
#
#     Jitter (\% )      escaped once   ->  renders  Jitter (%)      correct
#     Jitter (\\%  )    escaped twice  ->  renders  Jitter (  )     gone
#     Jitter (%)        never escaped  ->  renders  Jitter ()       eaten
#
# Measured by rendering all three. The middle line is what a
# double-sanitized title renders as, and a title IS sanitized twice:
# @emlComposeGraphTitle sanitizes each part it assembles (the value column via
# @emlCapitalizeLabel, which returns "Jitter (\% )") and @emlDrawAxes
# sanitizes the finished title again.
#
# THE IDEMPOTENCE IS HERE RATHER THAN A REMOVED CALL AT THE DRAW SITE.
# @emlDrawAxes' second call is what protects a user-TYPED title, and a user's
# title is the one string in the figure this procedure cannot assume anything
# about. So the escaper is safe to apply twice, and both call sites stay.
#
# HOW: NORMALISE, then escape. Every escape already present is undone first,
# so the string reaching the escaping pass is in exactly one state whatever
# state it arrived in. A sentinel-and-restore scheme was tried first and
# rejected: every sentinel that can be written in a Praat string literal is a
# string a label could also contain, so it trades one collision for another.
# Un-escaping has no such hole -- it is the exact inverse of the pass that
# follows it.

# A label containing the literal characters backslash-percent-space and
# meaning them literally round-trips to backslash-percent-space, which is what

#
# IT ONLY EVER REMOVES A SOUND THIS PLUGIN NAMED. The three candidates are
# "eml_" + the source's name + Praat's own conversion suffix, and the gate
# writes exactly that name onto the object it creates. A user's own
# "take_ch1", extracted by hand from the Objects window, does not match and

#
# `nocheck` because "no such object" is the ordinary case: the first press of

#
# WHY THE QUESTION IS ASKED AT ALL. A stereo recording -- and an
# EGG-plus-microphone recording is stereo by construction, which in this lab
# is most of them -- reaching a figure with no channel chosen is wrong in two
# different ways, depending on the figure.
#
#   THE WAVEFORM IS WRONG ON ITS OWN AXIS. Praat stacks the channels in two
#   half-height panels, while the plugin has installed a single amplitude
#   axis across the whole frame. Measured: the axis reads -0.6 to 0.6 Pa,
#   channel 1 is drawn centred on +0.3 and channel 2 on -0.3, and NEITHER
#   trace sits where its amplitude says. A reader taking channel 1's peak off
#   that axis reads 0.55 Pa for a signal whose peak is 0.25. There is no
#   "draw them both" option here for that reason: it is not a view of the
#   data, it is a mislabelled one.
#
#   THE PITCH TRACK IS WRONG AS A NUMBER, WHICH IS WORSE. Praat converts to
#   mono silently on the way into To Pitch. On a 220 Hz-left / 330 Hz-right
#   test signal the resulting contour sits at about 110 Hz -- the F0 of the
#   mixture, a frequency present in NEITHER channel and in nothing the singer
#   did. A figure that looks entirely normal and reports a pitch nobody sang.
#   That is why the derived paths are gated too, and not only the Sound.
#
# THE ORIGINAL IS KEPT. emlChannelKeepOriginal is set for the call, so the
# user's stereo Sound stays in the Objects window and the derived mono Sound
# joins it. Nothing the user selected is deleted to draw a graph, and the
# derived object's own name records the choice, so a session that is saved
# and reopened still says which channel the figure came from.
#
# ONE PRESS, ONE DERIVED SOUND. The derived Sound is kept on purpose -- see
# the paragraph above -- and kept once PER SOURCE, not once per press. Five
# figures drawn from the same stereo recording with the same channel chosen
# would otherwise leave five Sounds called "<name>_ch1" in the Objects window,
# and that is not only clutter: `selectObject: "Sound take_ch1"` then answers
# with one of the five and the user cannot say which, with no error at all.
#
# TWO HALVES, AND THE FIRST IS WHAT MAKES THE SECOND SAFE.
#
#   THE DERIVED SOUND IS RENAMED to "eml_" + Praat's own derived name, so
#   "take_ch1" becomes "eml_take_ch1". The prefix is what makes the object
#   identifiable as the plugin's: a user who extracted the left channel by
#   hand from the Objects window has a Sound called "take_ch1", and a cleanup
#   that matched THAT name would delete their work to tidy up after itself.
#
#   THE STALE ONES ARE DROPPED AT THE TOP OF THE NEXT PRESS, which is the
#   placement @eml_dropStaleConverted uses and for the same reason: a cleanup
#   at the bottom of this procedure is skipped by exactly the errors it would
#   exist to survive, and would then leak on precisely the runs that
#   matter. All three candidate names are dropped -- _mono,
#   _ch1 and _ch2 -- because the choice can differ from press to press and
#   "one derived Sound per source" is the invariant, not "one per choice".
#   A script variable cannot carry the id between presses: each menu
#   invocation is a fresh script run with a fresh variable space, which is
#   why the object's NAME has to be what identifies it.
#
# THE STALE-ID REPAIR. The graphs form remembers the object it is working

# ============================================================================
# THE LEGEND PANEL — a legend that is handed a rectangle and stays inside it
# ============================================================================
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# The user types 6 x 4 and means it. If the only place a legend can go is
# INSIDE the plot, the only way to give a legend more room is to take room
# away from the data, and "make my figure square" is unsatisfiable: a square
# canvas with a legend carved out of it is not a square plot. The dimensions
# the user types describe the DATA AREA, and furniture is not billed to it.
#
# So the legend moves OUT and the EXPORT grows to cover it, rather than the
# plot shrinking IN. No new save path was invented for that:
# @emlAssertFullViewport already selects the bounding box of everything
# reported to @emlExpandDrawnExtent, and that is exactly the mechanism this
# needs.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXPORT GEOMETRY — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY PLACEMENT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PLOT RECTANGLE IS IDENTICAL IN ALL FIVE PLACEMENTS. It is
# @emlSetAdaptiveTheme's outer viewport, sized from the width and height the
# user asked for; nothing below ever moves it, shrinks it, or re-derives it.
# What the placement changes is how much of the picture the SAVED IMAGE
# covers:
#
#   1 Inside plot      Legend inside the data area, auto-corner. The caller
#                      reports NOTHING to @emlExpandDrawnExtent, so the
#                      exported extent equals the plot rectangle. This is the
#                      DEFAULT, and what a script that sets nothing gets.
#   2 Right of plot    Legend in its own rectangle beside the plot. The
#                      CALLER reports that rectangle, so
#                      @emlAssertFullViewport widens the saved image. A 6 x 4
#                      request still yields a 6 x 4 PLOT; the PNG simply
#                      comes out wider than 6 inches.
#   3 Below plot       The same, in height instead of width.
#   4 Separate figure  Legend drawn on its own parked canvas and NOT
#                      reported, so the figure exports at its own extent; the
#                      save path then writes the legend as a SECOND FILE
#                      beside the first (<name>_legend.png).
#   5 None             Nothing drawn, nothing reported.
#
# THAT IS WHY @emlDrawLegendPanel MUST NOT CALL @emlExpandDrawnExtent. One
# renderer serves a corner box that must not grow the export and a side panel
# that must; only the caller knows which it is asking for. Moving the report
# into the renderer would make placements 1 and 4 impossible to express.
#
# WHY THE RENDERER TAKES A RECTANGLE. A legend that computes its own box from
# the axes and draws wherever that lands has nothing to clamp against, and a
# label wider than the frame then overhangs the picture. A renderer that is
# GIVEN its bounds can clamp to them, and this one does: every label is
# measured, and one that will not fit its column is shortened with an
# ellipsis rather than drawn past the edge. Containment stopped being a thing
# the caller has to hope for and became arithmetic the renderer performs.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHERE. Both procedures below select the legend's OWN
# rectangle with `Axes: 0, w, 0, h` over a w x h inch rectangle, so one world
# unit is one inch and `Text width (world coordinates)` returns inches
# directly. Font size is set BEFORE `Select inner viewport` at every site.
# That is not a style rule: Praat converts the inner rectangle to an outer
# one using the font size IN FORCE AT THE TIME OF THE CALL and then maps
# world coordinates back through the font size in force LATER, so measuring
# at a font size other than the one that was set when the viewport was
# selected inflates every width. Measured on Praat 6.6.30: the string "Group
# label" measures 0.4967" when the viewport is selected at 7 pt and read at
# 7 pt, and 3.6229" when the viewport is selected at 7 pt and read at 20 pt —
# a factor of 2.55 on a font-size ratio of 2.86. That is why
# @emlMeasureGraphLayout delegates its legend estimate here rather than
# measuring at bodySize a box that @emlDrawLegend draws at annotSize.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlEllipsizeToWidth
# Shortens .text$ until it renders no wider than .maxWidth, appending "..."
# whenever anything was removed.
#
# REQUIRES a viewport already selected whose world units are inches (the
# legend panel's own `Axes: 0, w, 0, h`), and the font size already set to
# the size the text will be drawn at. Width comes from
# `Text width (world coordinates)`, so this is the real rendered width of the
# real string in the real font, not a character-count estimate.
#
# Arguments:
#   .text$     — the label, ALREADY passed through @emlSanitizeLabel
#   .maxWidth  — the budget, in world units (= inches)
# Outputs:
#   .result$   — the label, possibly shortened; "" if not even "..." fits
#   .didClip   — 1 if anything was removed
#
# THE TRAILING-BACKSLASH GUARD IS NOT DECORATION. @emlSanitizeLabel turns a
# user's "%" into "\% ", so a cut can land between the backslash and the
# character it escapes. A dangling "\" at the end of a Praat text string
# escapes what follows it and the label draws as garbage, so one more
# character comes off whenever a cut leaves one.

# Draws the legend into EXACTLY the rectangle it is handed.
#
# Arguments (inches, Praat picture coordinates — x rightward and y DOWNWARD
# from the top-left of the picture, the same system @emlSetAdaptiveTheme's
# outerLeft/outerRight/outerTop/outerBottom are in):
#   .x0, .x1   — left and right edge
#   .y0, .y1   — top and bottom edge
#   .fontSize  — the size legend text is drawn at
#
# Outputs (the contract):
#   .usedWidth   — inches actually consumed, <= .x1 - .x0
#   .usedHeight  — inches actually consumed, <= .y1 - .y0
#   .shown       — entries drawn in full
#   .truncated   — 1 if any entry was dropped
# and, passed through from the layout: .cells, .cols, .rows, .hidden,
# .capacity, .clamped; plus .usedX0/.usedX1/.usedY0/.usedY1, the consumed
# sub-rectangle in the SAME picture inches the arguments are in, which is
# what a caller reports to @emlExpandDrawnExtent.
#
# THE RECTANGLE IS A BUDGET, NOT A BOX. Hand in the space the legend is
# ALLOWED to occupy; the procedure lays out inside it, consumes what it needs
# and reports what it took. Do NOT hand in a rectangle you obtained by
# measuring first: the layout sizes each column to ITS OWN widest label while
# the column COUNT is derived from the widest label overall, so a rectangle
# shrunk to a previous measurement can fit fewer columns than that
# measurement chose. Measured 8 Aug 2026 on the 24-entry fixture
# harness/stress_cases/legend_cap.praat: measuring 6 x 4's data area gives
# two columns of twelve, and re-measuring inside the resulting box gives one
# column of eleven with fourteen entries dropped. Hence one measurement, of
# the budget, here — and hence .usedWidth/.usedHeight, so a caller that needs
# the real size can have it without measuring again.
#
# CONTENT IS ANCHORED TOP-LEFT unless the global emlLegendPanelAnchor$ says
# otherwise ("top-left" default, "top-right", "bottom-left", "bottom-right").
# That global is how placement 1 reaches a corner of the data area while
# still handing in the whole data area as its budget; every other placement
# leaves it at the default. It is read through variableExists, so a caller
# that has never heard of it gets top-left.
#
# MUST NOT DRAW OUTSIDE THE RECTANGLE. That is the load-bearing constraint of
# this whole design and it is what keeps a wide label inside the picture:
# the layout clamps the width, the ellipsis clamps the labels, the row count
# clamps the height, and Praat's own viewport clipping is the backstop. A
# change here that lets ink escape the rectangle re-opens the overhang for
# every placement at once.
#
# MUST NOT CALL @emlExpandDrawnExtent. See EXPORT GEOMETRY in the section
# header: an inside-plot legend must not grow the saved image and a side
# panel must, and only the caller knows which one it asked for. The caller
# reports.
#
# Reads the existing legend entry globals; does not write any of them.
#
# Leaves Colour Black, Line width 1.0 and `Font size: bodySize`. Leaves the
# VIEWPORT on the panel rectangle — a caller that will draw more of the
# figure afterwards must re-select its own, exactly as @emlDrawLegend does.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlDrawLegend
# Draws the legend for the current panel, WHERE THE USER ASKED FOR IT.
#
# This is the entry point every draw procedure calls. It is a PLACEMENT
# DISPATCHER over @emlDrawLegendPanel rather than a renderer of its own: it
# works out the rectangle the legend is allowed to occupy, hands that
# rectangle to the panel renderer, and — only when the placement puts the
# legend outside the
# plot — reports the rectangle to @emlExpandDrawnExtent so the saved image
# grows to cover it. See EXPORT GEOMETRY in the section header above.
#
# THE PLOT RECTANGLE IS NEVER TOUCHED BY ANY OF THIS. A 6 x 4 request yields
# a 6 x 4 plot in all five placements; placements 2 and 3 make the saved PNG
# larger than 6 x 4, they do not make the plot smaller.
#
# PLACEMENT COMES FROM THE GLOBAL emlLegendPlacement, read through
# variableExists and defaulting to 1. A script that sets nothing — every
# stress case, every PraatGen companion file, every caller in
# eml-draw-procedures.praat — gets placement 1, the corner box inside the
# data area.
# The plugin sets emlLegendPlacement from config_legendPlacement, whose
# encoding, registry and dialog live in eml-graphs-form.praat.
#
#   1 Inside plot     — DEFAULT. Auto-corner box inside the data area.
#   2 Right of plot   — own rectangle to the right; export widens.
#   3 Below plot      — own rectangle below; export heightens.
#   4 Separate figure — parked off-figure and saved as a second file.
#   5 None            — not drawn.
#
# THE PARKED BAND IS RESERVED SPACE, AND ITS TOP IS emlLegendSepY0. Placement
# 4 draws its legend on a patch of picture below everything the page holds:
# twelve inches below the bottom of the EXTENT UNION, and never above 24
# inches. Nothing else may draw at or below that line — the save path selects
# emlLegendSepX0/X1/Y0/Y1 and writes it as the second PNG, so ink placed there
# by anyone else lands in the legend file. Taking the band from the union
# rather than from the current panel is what makes it clear of SIBLING panels
# on a composed page as well as of the panel whose legend it is; on a single
# figure the union is that figure and the band sits where it always has.
#
# Requires global variables before call:
#   legendN          — integer, number of entries. The palette holds 24
#                      sub-group styles, so 24 is the number this has to
#                      draw; there is no hard ceiling above it, because the
#                      LAYOUT is what limits the box and a ceiling written
#                      here would be a second, disagreeing limit.
#   legendColor$[1..N] — RGB colour strings for each entry
#   legendLabel$[1..N] — text labels for each entry (pre-sanitized)
#
# Optional globals, unchanged in meaning:
#   legendPatterned / legendPattern[] / legendFill$[]  — patterned swatches
#   legendMarkered  / legendMarker[]  / legendMarkerLine — the marker key
#
# WHY THE SWATCH CARRIES THE PATTERN AND THE MARK. The palette's 24 styles
# are 8 hues x 3 fill patterns, so entries 1 and 9 have the SAME
# legendColor$ and differ only in the pattern; a legend that drew colour
# alone would print two identical swatches against two different names, which
# is the figure's indistinguishable-styles problem relocated into the key.
# The same argument makes the marker key draw @emlDrawMarker rather than a
# square.
#
# THE BOX IS LAID OUT TO FIT ITS RECTANGLE. Rows that fit the height and
# columns that fit the width are counted, the entries are poured down the
# FEWEST columns that fit the height, and only if the rectangle is still
# exceeded is anything dropped — and then the last cell reads "+N more" ON
# THE FIGURE and a NOTE naming both counts goes to the Info window. At 24
# entries on a 6 x 4 figure that is two columns of 12; a legend that fits in
# one column gets the identical single-column geometry. All of that lives in
# @emlMeasureLegendPanel and is shared with every placement. See there for
# the ellipsis: a label wider than the frame is shortened rather than drawn
# past the edge.
#
# Arguments:
#   xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax — current axis bounds (data coordinates)
#   position$ — corner for placement 1: "top-left" (default), "top-right",
#               "bottom-left", "bottom-right". Ignored by placements 2-5,
#               which have only one place to be.
#   fontSize  — font size for legend text (typically annotSize)
#
# Reports (procedure locals, readable by the caller after return — the names
# and meanings @emlDrawLegend has always published):
#   .nCols, .rowsPerCol — the layout chosen
#   .shown, .hidden     — entries drawn, entries folded into "+N more"
#   .capacity           — the rectangle's room, in cells
#   .boxLeft/.boxRight/.boxTop/.boxBottom — the box, IN DATA COORDINATES, so
#                         a caller keeping clear of the legend still can. For
#                         placements 2-4 these describe a rectangle outside
#                         the axis range, which is truthful: the legend is
#                         not in the plot any more and nothing in the plot
#                         needs to avoid it. For placement 5 the box is empty.
#   .placement          — the placement actually used, after clamping
#   .panelX0/.panelX1/.panelY0/.panelY1 — the rectangle, in inches
#   .truncated, .clamped — anything dropped / any label ellipsized
#
# Draws: filled white background, thin grey border, swatches drawn as the
#   mark, and text labels in axis text colour. Leaves Colour Black and Line
#   width 1.0. Restores Font size: bodySize and the panel viewport and axes
#   before returning, so the caller can carry on drawing the figure.

# @emlCheckNumericColumn
# Tests whether a Table column is safe to feed to number() for plotting.
#
# SAMPLING IS NOT ENOUGH. "Sample the first 5 rows, pass if ANY one of them
# parses" declares a column numeric when its first five cells happen to be
# numeric, or when it holds a single numeric cell among text, and every
# downstream draw procedure then aborts or draws garbage. So: EVERY row is
# scanned and EVERY non-empty cell must parse cleanly.
#
# Cell classification (one of four):
#   missing      — empty or whitespace-only, OR Praat's own native missing
#                  cell ("--undefined--", what "Get value:" reads back from a
#                  numeric cell set to `undefined`); not a failure, not
#                  evidence
#   numeric      — matches a strict decimal/exponent literal AND number()
#                  returns a defined value
#   coerced      — number() returns a value only via a lossy coercion, e.g.
#                  number("5,5")=5, number("30%")=0.3, number("1/2")=1,
#                  number("2 3")=2, number("0x10")=16, number("5x")=5.
#                  These are wrong-number hazards, NOT passes: they are
#                  counted as offending cells and force .isNumeric = 0.
#   non-numeric  — number() is undefined. Note that Praat's number() cannot
#                  parse a leading-dot literal (number(".5") is undefined),
#                  so ".5" lands here even though it looks numeric.
#
# .isNumeric = 1 only when at least one cell is numeric and no cell is
# coerced or non-numeric.
#
# Rows scanned are capped at .maxScanRows (100000) as a safety valve on
# pathological tables; ~37 us/row measured on Praat 6.6.30, so the cap costs
# a few seconds worst case and is far above any plottable table. When the cap
# bites, .truncated = 1 and the verdict rests on the scanned prefix only.
#
# Arguments: .tableId, .colName$

# Outputs:
#   .isNumeric        — 0/1 verdict (UNCHANGED NAME AND MEANING-AS-FLAG)
#   .nRows            — rows in the table
#   .nChecked         — rows actually scanned
#   .truncated        — 1 if .maxScanRows cap stopped the scan, else 0
#   .nNumeric         — cells that parsed cleanly
#   .nMissing         — empty/whitespace cells (treated as missing)
#   .nCoerced         — cells accepted by number() only via a lossy coercion
#   .nNonNumeric      — cells number() could not parse at all
#   .nBad             — .nCoerced + .nNonNumeric (total offending cells)

    # Praat draws an image from a file in Graphics_imageFromFile
    # (sys/Graphics_image.cpp). That function has a GDI+ branch for
    # Windows and a Quartz branch for macOS and NO cairo branch at all —
    # on Linux it computes its coordinates and returns without drawing.
    # No error, no return code, nothing on the canvas.
    #
    # So on Linux a fileReadable test is not enough on its own: it passes,
    # .available goes to 1, the Paint circle fallback is skipped, and every
    # dot in a grouped scatter or a time-series CI band silently vanishes.
    # Verified on Praat 6.6.30/GTK by drawing a
    # Paint circle and an Insert picture from file side by side in the
    # Picture window: the circle appeared, the image did not, for both an
    # RGBA sprite and a plain RGB PNG. Not an alpha problem, not a path
    # problem — THAT ENTRY POINT has no implementation.
    #
    # It is only that entry point, and the distinction matters, because
    # "Linux cannot draw images" is the wrong lesson. Probed on the same
    # build:
    #
    #   Read from file: on a PNG           -> a Photo object. Works.
    #   Paint image: on an OPAQUE Photo    -> draws, in full colour.
    #                                         FF0000 landed over blue.
    #   Create Photo: + Paint image:       -> same, with no file at all.
    #   Paint image: on an RGBA Photo      -> draws, but does NOT
    #                                         composite: it renders flat
    #                                         grey equal to the alpha
    #                                         value (a=179 -> B3B3B3).
    #   Extract red / Extract transparency -> Matrix objects. Work.
    #   Matrix -> Photo recombine          -> no such command found.
    #   Create Photo: with an alpha plane  -> impossible; the command
    #                                         takes 14 arguments, being
    #                                         a name, five x-params, five
    #                                         y-params and THREE colour
    #                                         formulas. There is no
    #                                         transparency formula.
    #
    # So Praat rasterises images on Linux perfectly well through
    # Graphics_image (the cell-array path); it is Graphics_imageFromFile
    # that is missing its cairo branch. What is unreachable from script
    # on ANY platform is alpha compositing: you cannot author a
    # transparency plane, Paint image ignores the one a file carries, and
    # the Photo -> Matrix -> Photo round trip that would let you blend by
    # hand is broken at the recombine step.
    #
    # Which is why the Linux fallback is a screen door and not the Photo
    # route. Routing the sprite through Paint image would draw the box
    # OPAQUE GREY -- strictly worse than the opaque white it replaces.
    # Cost is not the reason either; measured on this build, per box:
    # Paint rectangle 0.009 ms, Paint image 0.027 ms, screen door
    # 0.064 ms. Sixty-four microseconds is not a budget anyone is
    # spending. The sprite is used on macOS and Windows because it is
    # correct there, not because the alternatives are slow.
    #
    # Opaque dots on Linux are a real cosmetic loss in dense scatters.
    # A blank plot is not a cosmetic loss. If Praat ever gains a cairo
    # branch, delete this gate and nothing else changes.

# Arguments:
#   .tableId     — Table object ID
#   .groupCol$   — group column name
#   .valueCol$   — value column name
#   .errorMode   — 0=none, 1=SE, 2=SD, 3=custom column

#
# UNDEFINED-VALUE DISCIPLINE. An unparseable cell in the value column that
# entered the accumulation would make .sum / .sumSq / the group mean
# undefined, and because "undefined > 0" is FALSE the SE/SD guard would take
# the else branch and report error = 0 while the undefined mean reached
# @emlDrawBarChart's "Paint rectangle:" and aborted the ENTIRE figure with
# «Argument "To y" has the value "undefined"». So undefined observations are
# skipped during accumulation (the guard pattern @emlDrawGroupedViolin uses),
# counted, and disclosed; every use of a mean or variance is guarded with an
# explicit "<> undefined" test.
#
# v3.23 (7 Aug 2026): ZERO IS NOT "NO DATA". The v3.22 invariant below used
# to read "emlBarData_mean[g] and emlBarData_error[g] are ALWAYS defined
# numbers on return", with 0 standing in for both "no usable observation" and
# "undefined error". It kept undefined out of the drawing commands, and it
# would also make the two claims indistinguishable downstream:
# @emlDrawBarChart guards every bar with "emlBarData_mean[g] <> undefined"
# and every whisker with "emlBarData_error[g] <> undefined", and a seeded 0
# means NEITHER GUARD CAN FIRE. Its .nSkippedBars and .nSkippedErrors
# counters would be dead code and both disclosures that read them
# unreachable; a group with nothing in it would draw as a bar of height zero
# — the same picture a genuine measurement of zero draws — and an undefined
# error bar would draw no whisker with no note.
#
# Invariant (hard): emlBarData_mean[g] is undefined exactly when
# emlBarData_valid[g] = 0, and emlBarData_error[g] is undefined exactly when
# emlBarData_errorDefined[g] = 0. The sentinel is the SAME undefined the
# consumers already test for, so "no measurement" now reaches the caller as a
# distinct value from a measurement of zero, and the two existing guards

# CALLERS MUST GUARD. Every read of emlBarData_mean[g] / emlBarData_error[g]
# needs either a "<> undefined" test or a valid[g] / errorDefined[g] test
# first; an unguarded one reaches Praat's drawing commands and aborts the
# figure with «Argument "To y" has the value "undefined"». The three readers
# in this repository —
# @emlDrawBarChart's bar loop, its error-bar loop, and its quadrant-occupancy
# scan — were already written that way, which is why they were dead. The
# visible-range scan at the foot of this procedure was NOT: it summed
# mean + error unguarded and would have dropped every group from the axis
# range under errorMode = 0, so it now substitutes 0 for an undefined error.

#
# Outputs
#   .result      the new object's id, or 0 when this pair is not one it reaches
#   .temporary   1 when the caller must remove .result after drawing, 0 when
#                the conversion produces a working object the session keeps
#
# WHY THIS IS A PROCEDURE. Several of the plugin's figures are drawn from
# objects the user never makes. Select a Sound and ask for an F0 contour, a
# spectrum or an LTAS; select a Spectrum and ask for any of those; select a
# Matrix or a TableOfReal and ask for anything table-shaped -- the plugin
# converts, draws, and in the acoustic cases REMOVES the intermediate at the
# end of the pass. A Sound is what comes off a recorder, so for three of the
# four acoustic figures this is the path most users take.
#
# ALL FIVE CONVERSIONS ARE HERE, not inline inside @emlGraphsWorkflow's
# beginPause: loop, where the only way to reach one is a real X display and a
# driven dialog. Reachability is not the only reason: the recorder's capture
# hook is inside the DRAW procedure, which is handed the INTERMEDIATE, so a
# figure recorded from an inline conversion emits
#
#     data1$ = "Pitch tone"   ; step 3 (draw)
#
# naming, as the object the reader must have open, something the plugin
# deletes at the end of the pass and the user never created. Such a script
# cannot run.
#
# THE CONVERSION IS RECORDED AS A STEP, so the manifest names what the USER
# selected and the emitted file carries the command that derives the rest,
# parameters included. The pitch floor and ceiling are a methods-section
# fact and belong in the record.
#
# .temporary IS NOT COSMETIC. The acoustic conversions produce an object the
# form removes; the Matrix and TableOfReal ones produce a Table the session
# goes on working with, and removing that would take the user's data view
# with it. The distinction is stated rather than left to whether a branch
# happens to assign loadedObjectId.
#
# Guarded on the recorder's PRESENCE, not on recording state: this file must
# stay loadable without eml-record.praat, which harness/norecord pins.

# SEVERAL COLUMNS BECOME THE ONE SHAPE THE DRAWING LAYER TAKES, and the user
# is never asked about it.
#
# The draw procedures see long format only -- time, series name, value -- and
# always have. What changed with the question tree is that the melt stopped
# being the consequence of a question ("is your data wide or long?") and
# became what it always was: an implementation detail between the columns the
# user ticked and the figure they asked for.
#
# IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN eml-graphs-form.praat, and that is the whole of the
# 19 August move. @emlCleanConvertedTable's header two screens down states the
# rule and the reason: a procedure a RECORDED step emits a call to must be in
# a file the emitted script includes, and the emitted script includes the
# graph, annotation and draw procedures and NOT the form. Until this moved,
# a melted-subjects figure recorded from the menu emitted a draw step whose
# manifest read `data1$ = "Table eml_melt"` -- an object the form removes
# before the workflow returns -- and replaying it stopped dead at
#
#     Error: No object with name "Table eml_melt".
#
# The form now records the melt as a CONVERSION, exactly as
# @emlConvertForGraph records Sound -> Pitch, and the emitted file rebuilds
# the melt from the user's own Table. Driven by harness/linetree's
# rec_subjects4 leg, which replays what it emitted.
#
# THE COLUMNS ARE AN ARGUMENT AND NOT A GLOBAL, for the same reason. They were
# read out of tsSeriesCol$[], which the dialog fills from the ticks -- a
# variable no emitted script has, and one a reader of the emitted file could
# not see or edit. They now arrive as one comma-separated string, which is the
# `seriesCols$` SPEC section 8 names, and which reaches the block by the same
# route every other column name does: @emlRecordColumnSpec lifts argument 3.
#
# tsSeriesCol$[] IS STILL FILLED, from that string, because the form reads it
# after the melt and because a caller that wants the array gets it either way.
# The form passes a list it built from the array, so the round trip is the
# identity.

# ============================================================================
# THE MIRROR IMAGE OF @emlReshapeSeriesLong, AND IT IS HERE FOR THE SAME
# REASON: the user is never asked about it.
#
# The melt takes several columns of one measurement and stacks them into the
# long shape the drawing layer takes. This takes the LONG shape -- one value
# column beside a column that names what was measured -- and spreads the
# levels back out into one column each, which is the two-column table the
# right-hand axis is drawn from. @emlDrawTimeSeries takes a left column and a
# right column by NAME; it has no concept of a level, and teaching it one
# would be a change to the most heavily pinned procedure in the plugin to buy
# something a table transform buys outright.
#
# MEANING AND STORAGE ARE INDEPENDENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
# QUESTION TREE. The tree asks what the columns MEAN and works the shape out
# for itself, so "two different measurements" has to reach the same figure
# whether the file holds them side by side or stacked -- and long is the shape
# every EML stats tool in this plugin emits. Making the right-hand axis a
# wide-only capability would re-couple the two after the tree had just pulled
# them apart. harness/linetree's long_meas2 leg drives the same keystrokes as
# its meas2 leg over the same numbers in the other shape and requires the two
# PNGs to be the same file.
#
# WHY THE LEVELS ARRIVE AS ONE COMMA-SEPARATED STRING. It is the shape
# @emlReshapeSeriesLong' `.cols$` already has, and for the same reason: the
# recorder lifts a call's string literals into the editable block, so a list
# that is one literal is one line a reader can retarget. A level whose own
# name contains a comma cannot be carried this way, and the FORM refuses that
# table by name rather than letting this procedure split it wrongly and draw a
# figure with a series missing.
#
# HOW IT IS BUILT, AND WHY THE SORT IS NOT COSMETIC. The working copy is
# sorted by (time, name), so every row sharing a time value is contiguous and,
# within that, every row of one level is contiguous too. One pass then reads
# the whole table: for each time, the k-th observation of each level goes to
# the k-th output row of that time. A time point where one level was measured
# three times and another twice produces three rows, and the level with two
# leaves the third cell UNDEFINED -- which @emlDrawTimeSeries drops outright,
# the same treatment a blank cell gets anywhere else in this plugin.
#
# ROW ORDER IS NOT PART OF THE RESULT, and that is measured rather than
# assumed: @emlDrawTimeSeries copies its table and sorts it before it reads a
# single value. The rows come out in ascending time because that is what the
# sort this procedure needs anyway leaves behind.
