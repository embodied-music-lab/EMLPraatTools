# EML Graphs Plugin

# Version: 2.9
# Date: 11 May 2026
#
#
# Purpose: Interactive form workflow for EML Graphs. Contains the graph type
#          registry, config persistence, context detection, type-specific
#          form dialogs, and the main drawing workflow. Called by eml-graphs.praat
#          (standalone entry), stats wrappers (after convergence), and the
#          wizard (after convergence).
#
# This file provides @emlGraphsWorkflow: .objectId — the single entry point
#          for all interactive graph creation. It is not part of the draw-layer
#          API used by advanced coders or PraatGen.
#
# Dependencies (must be included by the calling script BEFORE this file):

# gridModeStyle[t] — how many options type t's "Gridline mode" optionmenu has.

#   2 = "Horizontal" / "Off"                                   (categorical x)
#
# C1. These two menus are NOT two spellings of one control; they are two
# different encodings of `.gridMode`, and the draw layer documents both
# (eml-draw-procedures.praat :560 :656 :721 :789 :1180 :1607 :2970 for the
# four-option form, :1947 :2409 :2831 for the two-option form). Sharing ONE
# persisted key, `config_gridlineMode`, written from whichever type is drawn
# last and seeded straight back into whichever type is opened next, has two
# consequences:
#
#   1. A four-option type could put 3 or 4 into a two-option menu. Praat draws
#      an optionmenu whose default index exceeds its option count BLANK and
#      then refuses the form — "No option chosen for 'Gridline mode'." The
#      value is on disk, so the dead-end dialog survived a restart. Bar,
#      violin and box carried a hand-propagated clamp; histogram, grouped
#      violin, grouped box and spaghetti did not.
#   2. The clamp that did exist preserved the INDEX, not the MEANING:
#      "Horizontal only" (4-option 2) arrived as "Off" (2-option 2), and "Off"
#      (4-option 4) arrived as "Horizontal" (2-option 1). Inverted both ways.
#
# The fix is one canonical encoding — `config_gridlineMode` is ALWAYS the
# four-option encoding, on disk and in memory — plus translation at the one
# boundary where the two encodings meet, the dialog. @emlSeedGridMode converts
# canonical -> this type's menu, @emlCommitGridMode converts back. `tmpGridMode`
# and the form's own `gridline_mode` are always in the OPENED TYPE'S encoding,
# which is also what the draw procedures expect, so the dispatch calls at the
# bottom of this file are unchanged.
#
# ADDING A GRAPH TYPE: add its row here. You cannot forget — @emlGridModeStyle
# refuses an unregistered type by name, and the file-scope check below refuses
# to load at all if any type in 1..nGraphTypes is missing or is neither 2 nor
# 4. validate/v31_gridmode.R additionally cross-checks every row here against
# the option list actually written under that type's optionmenu, so a row that
# disagrees with its own dialog fails the suite.

#   0 = this graph type has no legend, and shows no menu at all
#
# NOT EVERY GRAPH TYPE HAS A LEGEND. Seven of the thirteen never call
# @emlDrawLegend — the four acoustic types (Pitch Contour, Waveform,
# Spectrum, LTAS) draw one series, and Bar Chart, Violin Plot and Box Plot
# put their group names on the x-axis where a key would be a second copy of
# the same information. The six that do are the six whose draw procedures
# contain a call:
#
#     grep -n '@emlDrawLegend' plugin/graphs/eml-draw-procedures.praat
#
# returns @emlDrawTimeSeries and @emlDrawTimeSeriesCI (both type 5),
# @emlDrawScatterPlot (8), @emlDrawHistogram (10), @emlDrawGroupedViolin
# (11), @emlDrawGroupedBoxPlot (12) and @emlDrawSpaghettiPlot (13). A type
# whose legend is conditional on a grouping column — scatter, histogram, line
# chart — still offers the control, because the type can produce a legend;
# the draw procedure decides whether this particular figure has one.
#
# THIS IS THE SAME SHAPE AS gridModeStyle[] ABOVE, AND FOR THE SAME REASON.
# Read that block for what the shape prevents: two encodings sharing one
# persisted key seed a dropdown with a default index past its option count,
# which Praat draws blank and then refuses to close — a dialog with no way
# out, and it survives a restart because the bad value is on disk.
# `config_legendPlacement` has exactly ONE encoding — 1 Inside plot / 2 Right
# of plot / 3 Below plot / 4 Separate figure / 5 None, on disk and in memory,
# for every type — so the translation @emlSeedGridMode has to perform is an
# identity here. It is still routed through @emlSeedLegendPlacement and
# @emlCommitLegendPlacement, because the clamp, the registry check and the
# single-token seed site are the load-bearing parts, and because a second
# encoding invented later has one place to go rather than fourteen.
#
# ADDING A GRAPH TYPE: add its row here. You cannot forget —
# @emlLegendPlacementStyle refuses an unregistered type by name, and the

# PROCEDURES — Gridline mode: one canonical encoding, translated at the dialog
# ============================================================================
#
# See the gridModeStyle[] block in the GRAPH TYPE REGISTRY for what these
# exist to prevent. In short: `config_gridlineMode` is the ONE persisted
# gridline key and it is ALWAYS in the four-option encoding —
#
#     1 = Both   2 = Horizontal only   3 = Vertical only   4 = Off
#
# — regardless of which type wrote it. Types whose x-axis is categorical show
# a two-option menu (1 = Horizontal, 2 = Off) and therefore need a translation
# in both directions. Every seed of `tmpGridMode` goes through
# @emlSeedGridMode and every write back to `config_gridlineMode` goes through
# @emlCommitGridMode, so no per-type section has to know that two encodings
# exist — which is what the shared-tmp comment in @emlGraphsWorkflow says.
#
# Round trip, for the two values a user can actually express on a categorical
# type: "Horizontal" -> canonical 2 -> "Horizontal" (stable), "Off" ->
# canonical 4 -> "Off" (stable). Coming the other way the map is lossy because
# it must be — a two-option menu cannot express "Both" or "Vertical only" —
# but it is lossy by MEANING and not by index: "Both" and "Horizontal only"
# both arrive as "Horizontal", "Vertical only" and "Off" both arrive as "Off".
# Turning gridlines off on a scatter plot turns them off on the next
# histogram, which is the whole user-visible point.

#
#     1 = Inside plot   2 = Right of plot   3 = Below plot
#     4 = Separate figure   5 = None
#
# WHAT THE PLACEMENT MEANS, because it is the reason the setting exists: the
# user's width and height describe the PLOT, and the plot is the same size in
# all five. Placement 1 draws the legend inside the data area and the saved
# image is the plot rectangle. Placements 2 and 3 put the
# legend in its own rectangle beside or below the plot and the SAVED IMAGE
# GROWS to cover it — a 6 x 4 request still yields a 6 x 4 plot and simply
# exports a bigger picture. Placement 4 writes the legend as a second file.
# Placement 5 draws none. The geometry is in @emlDrawLegend and the block
# above @emlDrawLegendPanel in eml-graph-procedures.praat; nothing here
# computes a rectangle.
#
# WHY THE GRIDLINE SHAPE, WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE ENCODING. Read the
# gridModeStyle[] block in the GRAPH TYPE REGISTRY: two encodings sharing one
# persisted key leave a dropdown blank and unusable, on disk, surviving a
# restart. The translation is only half of what that pattern provides. The
# other half — a registry every type must appear in, a named refusal for one
# that does not, a clamp at the single point where the value is read from
# disk, and ONE seed token and ONE commit token so a fifteenth call site
# cannot be written differently — is what keeps a second encoding from being
# invented here later. So the translation procedures exist and are identities
# today. If a type ever needs a shorter menu, this is where it goes, and no
# per-type section has to learn about it.

# ============================================================================
#
# A CUSTOM AXIS LABEL BELONGS TO THE PAGE IT WAS TYPED ON, FOR THE SESSION.
# Every column-mapping page opens by clearing tmpXLabel$ and tmpYLabel$, so
# without a store the label a user typed would be gone the moment the page was
# re-entered -- in the same session, on the same graph type, with the font and
# the DPI set on the same dialog still in place. @emlSeedAxisLabels reads this
# store on entry to every page, which is also what keeps the advanced stash
# alive across a graph-type switch.
#
# WHY A TYPE-KEYED ARRAY AND NOT THE CONFIG FILE. `config_xLabel$` and
# `config_yLabel$` are written by @emlSaveConfig and parsed by @emlLoadConfig
# and are read by NOTHING -- and they cannot honestly be wired up as they
# stand, because they are ONE pair of keys for THIRTEEN graph types. "Time
# (s)" restored onto a bar chart's group axis is not persistence, it is a
# wrong label with a user's own words in it. They stay in the file because the
# format is on disk already and an unknown key is not the config parser's
# problem to have. Within a session the label belongs to the type it was typed
# for, which is what this array says.
#
# BEGINNER MODE READS NOTHING. The beginner page has no axis-label field, and
# beginner mode draws only what its own dialog offers. Seeding a stored label
# into a page that cannot show it would put a label on a figure with nothing

# ADJUSTMENT-METHOD LOOKUP
# ============================================================================
# Maps the "Adjustment method (nonparametric post-hoc only)" optionmenu index
# used by every annotate-capable column-mapping dialog onto the string that
# @emlBridgeGroupComparison expects in annotCorrectionMethod$. Index 2 (Holm)
# is the default everywhere.
#
# THE CONTROL IS CONSUMED ONLY ON THE NONPARAMETRIC (DUNN) POST-HOC PATH.
# A parametric k >= 3 comparison annotates with Tukey, whose p comes from the
# studentized range distribution and is ALREADY family-wise, so a Holm or a
# Bonferroni step on top of it would double-correct: a Tukey draw is
# md5-identical under either, and it is right to be. There is nothing honest
# for the menu to do on that arm.
#
# SO THE MENU IS OFFERED ONLY ON THE NONPARAMETRIC ARM, on all six
# annotate-capable column-mapping dialogs, and the parametric arm gets a
# `comment:` in its place saying why there is nothing to choose. A live-looking
# control that is silently ignored is the same class of defect as an editable
# field whose value is thrown away at the commit, and the remedy is the same:
# gate the field, do not qualify its label. The Dunn arm keeps the menu,
# because it reads it — Holm and Bonferroni produce DIFFERENT annotated
# p-values there, both matching scipy.
#
# The field name still carries the condition in parentheses, because Praat
# cannot grey a field out conditionally inside a single form — the whole form
# is built before the user touches anything. Praat strips a trailing
# parenthesised part when it derives the variable name, so the value arrives
# as adjustment_method.
#
# WHAT DECIDES, AND WHY IT IS A VARIABLE RATHER THAN A RE-TEST.
#
# `adjustOffered` is set to 0 immediately before the dialog is built and to 1
# in the same branch that adds the field, so ONE value answers both "was the
# field on the dialog" and "may adjustment_method be read back". Re-testing
# the test-type variable at the commit is not the same question, and on three
# of the six pages it is the WRONG question: the histogram, the grouped-violin
# and the grouped-box commits write `prev_<x>AnnotTestType = test_type` a line
# or two ABOVE the adjustment read, so by the time a re-test ran the variable
# it would test has already been overwritten with the user's NEW choice. A
# user who opened the page parametric and switched to Nonparametric before
# pressing Draw would then pass the gate and read an adjustment_method that
# was never on the screen — which in Praat is not an error but the value left
# over from the last dialog that did have the field, on a different graph
# type, possibly in a different session state.
#
# Praat does not delete a pause variable when the field goes away, so
# READING WITHOUT THE GATE CANNOT FAIL LOUDLY. It returns stale data. That is
# the whole reason the gate is one variable set next to the field rather than
# a condition re-derived at the commit.
#
# A PARAMETRIC COMMIT LEAVES annotCorrectionMethod$ ALONE, and loses nothing
# by it: the global is initialised to "holm" at file scope and a wrapper preset
# writes it through @emlAdjustMethodName before the form opens, so the value in
# hand is already the one a menu seeded from the same source would produce.

# the paired workflow is the `pairedLong` wide-to-long reshape the wrapper
# builds for the spaghetti plot — a transient the user never created, never
# named and never sees again. Naming the deliverable after it would disagree
# with the rows INSIDE it, which say `demo_paired`. The name comes from the
# same place the body does.
#
# THE ANALYSIS. "_results" carries no analysis identity, so three different
# analyses on one table would propose one name and arrive as `t_results.csv`,
# `_1.csv`, `_2.csv` — distinguishable only by opening them. The shape here is
# <table>_<analysis-slug>, the same convention and the same slug rules as
# @emlWrapperExportCSV in stats/eml-output.praat, so the two export routes
# cannot drift.
#
# When the buffer is empty or unparseable the <table>_results shape is
# produced instead, from the caller's fallback name.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE: the Draw path can export a different test family
# than the analysis the user launched, because the draw bridge re-runs its own
# test and overwrites the buffer. Naming the file after the buffer makes that
# visible rather than hiding it behind the table name. Which result should win

# PERCENTAGE-COLUMN DETECTION
# ============================================================================
# @emlComputeAxisRange takes an .isPercentage argument and clamps the axis to
# 0-100 (or 0-1 for proportions) when it is raised — Rule 28E. Without it a
# `_pct` column with a ceiling of exactly 100.0 gets Rule 28F's generic +-10%
# buffer: an axis running 40-110, ten points past a physically impossible
# value and cropping the bottom 40 points of the actual scale.
#
# Detection deliberately requires BOTH tests to pass:
#
#   * the NAME suggests a percentage (`_pct`, `percent`, `%`) — necessary,
#     because 0-100 data is extremely common in acoustics (SPL in dB, F0 in a
#     narrow band, age, contact quotient x 100) and clamping all of it to a
#     0-100 axis would wreck far more figures than it would rescue; and
#   * the DATA actually lies in 0-100 — necessary, because a name is only a
#     hint. `pct_change` legitimately goes negative, and a column called
#     `percent_of_baseline` can run past 200. Either would be silently
#     truncated by a name-only rule, which is a worse failure than the one
#     being fixed: a clipped axis hides data, a buffered axis only wastes ink.
#
# Data in 0-1 is left to @emlComputeAxisRange, which reads dataMax <= 1 as a
# proportion and clamps to 0-1 instead.

# The min and max of a numeric column, OVER THE DEFINED CELLS ONLY.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `Get maximum:`. Praat's Table query does not
# return undefined for a column containing a blank cell -- it ABORTS:
#
#     Error: Table "t": the cell in row 3 of column "v" is undefined.
#     Table "t": cannot compute maximum of column 1.
#
# Measured on 6.6.30 with a single blank cell in a five-row column. So a
# `Get maximum:` on the user's raw table would kill the whole workflow for a
# violin or box plot with Annotate ticked, at least one bracket and one
# missing value anywhere in the value column -- and an `if visibleDataMax <>
# undefined` guard after it cannot help, because the call never returns to be
# tested.
#
# Missing values are the ordinary case, not the exotic one, and every draw
# procedure already tolerates them: they skip the row and say so ("6 row(s)
# skipped (missing or non-numeric value)"). This makes the headroom stage
# agree with the figure it is buying room for -- the extent is taken over
# exactly the rows that get drawn.
#
# Returns .min, .max, and .n (the number of defined cells). With .n = 0 both
# bounds come back undefined, and the caller's existing undefined test then
# does what it was written to do.
#
# THE READER HERE MUST BE THE DRAW LAYER'S READER, which is @eml_readCell
# (see @emlDrawColumnIsClean) and not `Get value:`. A lenient reader here
# would put a `1,5` read as 1 and a `30%` read as 0.3 into the extent, so the
# axis would reserve room for two points the figure does not draw.
#
# An extent that DISAGREES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION is worse still -- excluding
# a point the figure plots clips data off the page. Either way the rule is
# the same: this reads cells the way the figure reads them, and if one
# changes the other changes with it.

# DEFAULT FIGURE TITLE

# A BLANK TITLE FIELD GETS A COMPOSED TITLE, NOT NO TITLE (Rule 28A). Blank
# is the out-of-box case on every path, and the plugin knows the table name
# and every mapped column, so a reader given the PNG alone can tell what was
# measured and on what.
#
# WHY IT IS COMPOSED HERE AND NOT IN THE FORM. The Title field lives on the
# FIRST page of the dialog — above the graph-type menu and two pages above the
# column mapping — so at the moment Praat builds that field there is nothing
# to compose from. Praat forms are built in one pass; a field cannot read a
# value the user has not been shown yet. The title is therefore composed at
# draw time, where every mapped column name is known, and written back into
# prev_title$ so that from the SECOND invocation onwards the Title field opens
# pre-filled with the composed text and the user can edit or clear it.
#
# The caller keeps prev_autoTitle$ = this procedure's last result. A title
# equal to that string is one the user accepted rather than wrote, so it is
# recomposed from the current mapping instead of being carried over stale when
# the graph type or the columns change.
#
# Column names go through @emlCapitalizeLabel / @emlSanitizeLabel, so an
# underscore in a column name becomes a space rather than a Praat subscript
# marker and a "%" cannot turn the rest of the title italic. A title the user
# typed never reaches this procedure and is never rewritten.

# variables. Only the branch for the live graph type is evaluated, so the

# THE ONE PLACE AN AXIS PAIR IS JUDGED. Takes an axis name and the pair the
# dialog returned for it, and decides one thing: whether the form may proceed.
# It draws nothing, shows nothing and changes neither number.
#
#   .refused    1 when the pair cannot be used, 0 otherwise
#   .headline$  the one-line statement of the conflict, with both numbers
#   .message$   the whole refusal as a single sentence-run
#
# A PAIR IS REFUSED WHEN ITS MAXIMUM IS BELOW ITS MINIMUM, AND ONLY THEN.
# (0, 0) is the auto sentinel every axis dialog names on its own face, and it
# is not a conflict: the maximum is not below the minimum. (0, 100) is the
# ordinary full range from 0 to 100 and is not a conflict either. Nothing
# here treats 0 as absent.
#
# WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN REPAIRS. `maximum < minimum` has two readings and
# no evidence that separates them: the numbers may have been entered in the
# wrong order, or the user may have set one side and left the other at its
# default. A form field cannot be left empty, so "minimum 300, maximum 0"
# is exactly what a user asking for a floor of 300 submits — and it is also
# exactly what a user who typed 0 and 300 backwards submits. Choosing either
# reading silently gives one of them a figure drawn on an axis they did not
# ask for, with no mark on the page to say so. So the form asks.
#
# WHY THE MESSAGE NAMES BOTH READINGS. The user who reversed the pair needs to
# know the order; the user who wanted one side needs to know that a one-sided
# limit is not available on this axis, and why — 0 is simultaneously a
# legitimate bound and the auto sentinel, so a blank other side cannot be
# distinguished from a bound of zero.
#
# THE ACCUMULATOR. A page can carry more than one pair, so a refusal appends
# to emlGraphsAxisRefusalN / emlGraphsAxisRefusalLine$[] and the caller clears
# both before its sweep. Every pair on the page is judged, so a page with two
# reversed pairs names both at once rather than one per round trip.

# ============================================================================
# PUBLISH THE AXIS THE USER ASKED FOR, BEFORE ANYTHING IN THIS FILE RESOLVES
# IT. Sets two globals — emlGraphsAxisYReqMin and emlGraphsAxisYReqMax — from
# the dialog pair that belongs to the graph type about to be drawn, and does
# nothing else. No arguments, no output beyond those two names, no drawing.
#
# THE CONTRACT. The recorded script's editable top block shows what the user
# ASKED FOR, not what the draw resolved: (0, 0) is the sentinel the dialog
# names on its own face — "both 0 = auto" — and it reaches the block as 0.0 to
# 0.0 rather than as the computed extent. The recorded CALL carries the same
# choice. So the user's choice has to still be recoverable at the moment the
# recorder runs.
#
# WHY THE CAPTURE HAS TO HAPPEN HERE. Two paths through this file overwrite
# the dialog pair, both of them before the draw the recorder sees:
#
#   * @emlGraphsPreDispatchHeadroom — the bracket path. On an annotated bar,
#     violin or box plot with at least one bracket it computes the visible
#     extent, calls @emlComputeAxisRange, and writes the result back into
#     valueMin and valueMax; then it widens valueMax again by the bracket
#     headroom. By the time @emlGraphsDispatchDraw runs, the (0, 0) the user
#     chose is gone from every variable the draw procedure can see.
#
#   * @emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom — the legend path. It draws once, measures
#     the legend, writes the widened extent back into valueMin and valueMax,
#     and DRAWS AGAIN on it. The second draw is the one the recorder records,
#     so on every legend-bearing type the range in scope is the resolved one.
#
# A block carrying the resolved range would freeze one speaker's axis into a
# script whose whole purpose is to be re-run on the next speaker, and nothing
# would error on the way: "192.0000" is as well-formed a number as "0.0", and
# the figure would look like a figure. So the request is captured HERE, where
# the form's own range validation has just finished with the user's numbers
# and neither pass has run yet, and it is never written again for this press.
# @emlRecordAxisRequest in
# stats/eml-record.praat states the reading half of the contract, including
# why its fallback to the caller's own arguments is a requirement and not a
# courtesy: nothing outside this file publishes these globals, and the API
# export, the batch module, the Q-Q path and every harness reach a recorder
# with no form in the picture at all.
#
# BOTH OR NEITHER, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A PROCEDURE. The reader takes the
# pair as a pair — it requires variableExists on both names before it prefers
# either — so a path that published a minimum and not a maximum would hand the
# recorder a floor from the dialog and a ceiling from the resolved draw, which
# is a range nobody asked for and which the (0, 0) sentinel cannot survive.
# Every branch below assigns both names, there is no goto and no early return,
# and there is exactly one call site. Publishing from the four or five places
# the dialog values are read would have made the invariant a thing to audit
# rather than a thing to read.
#
# AND THE PAIR IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. Existence is permanent in Praat, so
# a pair published by one press would otherwise be preferred by every recorded
# draw after it for the life of the process — including draws from other menu
# commands with no form behind them at all. The pair is therefore published
# with a STEP STAMP, written by @emlGraphsStampAxisRequest below the type
# chain so that it travels with all thirteen types, refreshed at each dispatch
# and consumed by @emlRecordAxisRequest. That procedure's header says why the
# stamp cannot be folded back into the pair.
#
# THE PAIR IS CHOSEN BY GRAPH TYPE, because "the y-axis range" is not one
# variable in this form. @emlGraphsDispatchDraw hands the F0 contour freqMin
# and freqMax, the waveform ampMin and ampMax, the spectrum and the LTAS
# powerMin and powerMax, and everything from the time series down to the
# spaghetti plot valueMin and valueMax — and the recorder in each of those
# draw procedures reads whichever of those it was given. Publishing valueMin
# for a waveform would replace an amplitude range with a range the amplitude
# dialog never showed. Types 1 to 4 are not touched by either resolving pass,
# so for them the published value always equals the argument; they are
# published anyway because one rule with no exceptions is cheaper to keep true
# than four types carved out of it.
#
# WHAT A CHECK OF THIS CONTRACT HAS TO DO: read the VALUE in the emitted block
# on a draw whose axis was RESOLVED, knowing what the user typed. Nothing
# weaker reaches it. A probe that calls a draw procedure directly runs with no
# form and no globals, so the fallback fires and the round trip is
# byte-perfect whatever this procedure does. A PNG comparison sees nothing,
# because the figure is legitimately drawn on the resolved range. And a check
# on the WIDTH or the format of the block's numbers passes on the wrong one:
# "192.0000" and "0.0" are both well-formed four-decimal strings.

# @emlGraphsStampAxisRequest
# ============================================================================
# STAMP THE PUBLISHED PAIR WITH THE STEP IT IS FOR. Sets one global --
# emlGraphsAxisYReqStep -- and does nothing else. No arguments, no drawing.
#
# WHY A STAMP AND NOT JUST THE PAIR. PRAAT CANNOT UNSET A VARIABLE, so
# @emlGraphsPublishAxisRequest's two globals live for the whole process once
# any press has written them. A reader that preferred the pair whenever it
# EXISTED could not tell "this draw came from the form" from "some form ran
# earlier this session": existence is permanent, and both are the same two
# doubles. graphs/eml-draw-qq.praat calls @emlDrawScatterPlot with 0, 0, 0, 0
# and has no form of its own, so an EML Graphs draw at 0..100 earlier in the
# session must not reach a recorded Q-Q step as axisYMax = 100.0.
#
# THE PAIR CANNOT CARRY THAT STATE AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Resetting the
# pair after use would mean writing 0 and 0 into it, and 0/0 IS the auto
# sentinel -- the range a user gets by leaving the dialog alone -- so "spent"
# and "the user asked for auto" would be the same two doubles. The stamp has
# no such collision: step numbers start at 1, so 0 means CONSUMED and nothing
# else, and @emlRecordAxisRequest zeroes it the moment it has read it. That is
# the trick; a reader who folds the stamp back into the pair loses the
# distinction and cannot get it back.
#
# THE NUMBER IS THE RECORDER'S NEXT STEP. @emlRecordStep increments emlRecordN
# and then appends, and @emlRecordAxisRequest runs before it, so the row the
# draw is about to become is emlRecordN + 1. Zero when nothing is recording,
# so a press made with the recorder off leaves no stamp armed for step 1 of a
# recording started afterwards.
#
# WHY IT IS TAKEN AGAIN AT DISPATCH AND NOT ONLY AT PUBLICATION. The pair must
# be published BEFORE anything in the form resolves it, which is why
# @emlGraphsPublishAxisRequest sits where it does -- but the step number is
# not knowable there. The annotation bridge runs between the publication and
# the draw and RECORDS A STEP OF ITS OWN: on an annotated violin the group
# comparison is step 1 and the figure is step 2, so a stamp taken at
# publication time names a step the draw will never be. Driven, not reasoned:
# harness/formaxis's bracket_auto leg emits exactly that pair of steps, and
# harness/consumeonce's form_then_qq leg re-drives it beside a second press.
#
# So the pair is published once, where the user's numbers are still the user's
# numbers, and the stamp is re-taken at each dispatch, where "the current step"
# is a fact. @emlGraphsDispatchDraw is also called once per LEGEND PASS, which
# is the second reason for the placement: the legend-room loop draws, measures
# and draws again, both passes record, and both are entitled to the request
# the user actually made.
#
# THE PAIR IS NEVER REWRITTEN HERE. Neither resolving pass may touch it --
# validate/v68 asserts that over the bodies of both -- and this procedure is
# not an exception to that rule but the reason it can stay absolute: what
# dispatch refreshes is the stamp, which is bookkeeping, and never the range,
# which by dispatch time holds the resolution.
#
# THE SELECTION IS PUT BACK. @emlRecordInit re-attaches to a recording left by
# an earlier menu invocation with `nocheck selectObject:` BY NAME, which either
# selects the buffer Table or leaves nothing selected. This procedure runs
# before a draw, so it restores objectId exactly as @emlGraphsComposeTitle
# does after its own object queries.

# The PRE-DISPATCH (HEADROOM) stage of @emlGraphsWorkflow. Aggregates the bar
# chart's data, records the visible data maximum the brackets are hung from,
# and — on an annotated bar, violin or box plot that has at least one bracket
# — resolves an auto y-range into the real extent and widens its ceiling to
# make room for the brackets. Draws nothing.
#
# LIFTED OUT VERBATIM, FOR THE REASON THE NEXT PARAGRAPH GIVES AND FOR NO
# OTHER. Not one statement changed in the move; the section had its own banner
# in @emlGraphsWorkflow and the banner is still at the call site, now with a
# single call under it. `.axisIsPct` and `.axisRoundTo` were locals of
# @emlGraphsWorkflow and are locals of this procedure now — nothing outside
# the moved block ever read either name.
#
# WHY IT IS A PROCEDURE. Because the alternative is a probe that transcribes
# it, and this file already carries the bill for that experiment. Read the
# header of @emlGraphsPostDispatchAnnotations: harness/disclosure/
# probe_formpath.praat called itself a reproduction of "the form's sequence"
# around the annotation block, transcribed it by hand, passed the wrong
# variable in the transcription, and therefore tested a CORRECTED copy of the
# block — it would have gone on passing however wrong the shipped one became,
# and it did, while an omnibus box was being clipped off the figure entirely.
# The bracket headroom is one of the two places in this file that turns the
# user's AUTO range into explicit numbers, so any check of the published axis
# request has to run it. A check that ran a hand-written copy of these ninety
# lines instead
# would be measuring its own copy, which is the same failure with a different
# variable name in it. There is nothing to transcribe now.
#
# NO PARAMETERS, and reads and writes main-body scope, exactly as

# @emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom
# ============================================================================
# The DISPATCH (DRAW) stage of @emlGraphsWorkflow. Draws the figure once, and
# a second time on a widened axis when the legend would otherwise sit on the
# data. Reads and writes main-body scope (graph_type, valueMin, valueMax,
# histFreqMax, config_legendPlacement, objectId, tsShowCI).
# ============================================================================
procedure emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom
    #
    # WHY THIS IS A LOOP. Headroom has to be in the axis BEFORE the data is
    # drawn on it, and the two facts it needs — the axis the figure resolves
    # for itself, and the corner @emlPlaceElements sends the legend to — do
    # not exist until the figure has been drawn once. Both are decided inside
    # the draw procedure, from the data, on the axis it just built.
    #
    # So the figure is drawn, measured and, ONLY IF the legend needs room,
    # erased and drawn again on the expanded axis. The first pass is thrown
    # away entirely. This is not a cheap trick around a missing accessor: the
    # alternative is for this file to re-derive every legend-bearing type's
    # auto-range with its own copy of that type's arithmetic — the value
    # column's extent for the violin family, the mean±CI band for the CI line
    # chart, the bin counts for the histogram — and a copy that drifts by one
    # rounding step changes the axis of every figure whether or not it has a
    # legend. Asking the draw procedure what it did cannot drift.
    #
    # The second pass costs one more render, and only for a figure that has a
    # legend inside the plot AND is a type that draws one (5, 8, 10, 11, 12,
    # 13). Every other figure draws exactly once, as it always has.
    #
    # WHAT IS RESET BETWEEN THE PASSES, and why each one:
    #   · annotBlockN. @emlDiscloseEnd already hands it back to its entry
    #     value, so this is belt and braces rather than the mechanism.
    #   · the drawn extent and the parked-legend flag, both reset per pass
    #     inside @emlGraphsDispatchDraw.
    #   · the object selection, because a draw procedure leaves whatever it
    #     was last looking at selected.
    # Nothing else survives a pass: the draw procedures write globals, and
    # pass 2 writes the same ones again from the same table.
    #
    # THE INFO WINDOW IS NOT REWOUND, AND THAT IS A DECISION. Pass 1 prints
    # its notes — row-skip counts, the mean-collapse disclosure, the legend's
    # own "+N more" — and pass 2 prints the same ones again. The obvious fix,
    # snapshotting info$() and putting it back with writeInfo:, is worse than
    # the problem it solves. Measured 9 Aug 2026 under `praat --run`: an
    # Info window holding "AAA" then "BBB", restored to the "AAA" snapshot,
    # produces the transcript AAA BBB AAA. Batch output is append-only —
    # Praat cannot un-print a line it has already flushed — so the restore
    # deletes nothing and re-emits the ENTIRE saved buffer, which on a figure
    # drawn after an analysis is the whole report a second time. A repeated
    # NOTE is noise; a repeated report is a different document.
    #
    # So the duplication is LABELLED instead. The line printed before pass 2
    # says the notes above it belong to a pass that was thrown away, which is
    # the same rule the rest of this plugin follows: say what happened rather
    # than hide it.

    # THE HALF THE PRESS-LEVEL RESET DOES NOT REACH.
    #
    # The scatter's reporters run from inside @emlDrawScatterPlot, so they run
    # once per PASS, and this loop dispatches twice whenever a legend inside
    # the plot needs y-axis room. The comment above says pass 1 "is thrown away
    # entirely"; its CSV rows have to go with it, or every (table, analysis,
    # term, field) key appears TWICE per press in the exported file. The Info
    # window's duplication is deliberate and LABELLED (see above) because Praat
    # cannot un-print a flushed line. A file it has not written yet is a
    # different matter: the rows can simply be rewound, and a figure that was
    # never on the page has no business in the export.
    #
    # THE MARK IS TAKEN HERE, not zeroed, because the annotation bridge has
    # already run and its rows belong to this press. Rewinding to the mark
    # discards exactly what a pass added and nothing that preceded it. The pair
    # lives in stats/eml-output.praat with the collector it counts.
    @emlCSVMark

    # THE RECORDER'S HALF OF THE SAME RESET, and it is the same sentence one
    # file over: ONE PRESS OF DRAW IS ONE DRAW STEP, on a legend-bearing
    # figure as much as on any other. Both passes of this loop reach the
    # recorder, so without a mark and a rewind one press emits
    #
    #     # --- Step 1 (draw) ---     @emlDrawGroupedViolin: ... axisYMin, axisYMax
    #     # --- Step 2 (draw) ---     @emlDrawGroupedViolin: ... axisYMin, axisYMax
    #
    # — the same figure twice. Worse than the duplication: the block's
    # resolved-range note quotes the FIRST step to use a pair, so it would
    # name the axis of the pass that was thrown away rather than the one on
    # the user's screen. harness/formaxis's legend_auto leg is the drive.
    #
    # SAME PLACEMENT AS THE CSV MARK, AND FOR THE SAME REASON. The annotation
    # bridge records a step of its own before this procedure is entered, and
    # that step belongs to this press; the mark is taken here so a rewind
    # discards exactly what a pass added and nothing that preceded it.
    #
    # THE REWIND MUST PRECEDE @emlGraphsDispatchDraw, not follow the pass that
    # is being discarded, because dispatch re-stamps the axis request with
    # emlRecordN + 1. Rewinding first is what makes the second pass stamp the
    # step it will actually be recorded as, so the figure keeps the user's own
    # axis request. The pair lives in stats/eml-record.praat with the buffer
    # it trims, and knows nothing about legends.
    #

    # decoration. The recorder is OPTIONAL BY DESIGN -- a hand-written user
    # script or a PraatGen companion that includes the stats and graphs files

    # harness/legendroom does, with a probe that includes the individual files
    # exactly as a user script would. Every recorder call site in the graphs
    # and draw files carries this same guard.

# ============================================================================
# @emlLegendHeadroomAfterDraw
# ============================================================================
# Decide, after a figure has been drawn once, whether its legend needs the
# y-axis widened and by how much. Draws nothing; measures.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Any extra room a figure needs is a property of what is
# drawn on it, not of the unit, and is supplied by
# @emlComputeAnnotationHeadroom at the annotation stage. That procedure's
# significance-bracket call site is gated on `(graph_type = 6 or 7 or 9) and
# annotate = 1 and annotBracketN > 0`, which no legend-bearing type can pass:
# the six types that draw a legend are 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13. So the legend
# needs its own measurement, or it lands on the data — on a five-group line
# chart at 6 x 4 that is 13145 data pixels covered, measured on the PNG.
#
# @emlPlaceElements is not a substitute. It scores the four corners and takes
# the emptiest; on a figure whose data reaches all four corners the emptiest
# corner still has data under it. Choosing is not the same as making room.
#
# Arguments:
#   .placement     — config_legendPlacement, canonical. Only 1 (Inside plot)
#                    can collide with data. 2 and 3 grow the saved image
#                    around an unchanged plot, 4 writes a second file, 5
#                    draws nothing — none of them take a square inch of the
#                    data area, so none of them earns an axis change.
#   .legendCorner$ — emlDrawLegend.position$ as of the draw that just ran,
#                    blanked before it, so "" means no legend was drawn.
#   .baseYMin/.baseYMax — the axis the figure resolved for ITSELF, read back
#                    from the draw procedure. Not a re-derivation.
#   .fontSize      — the size the legend is drawn at (annotSize), which is
#                    also the size it must be MEASURED at. Measuring at
#                    bodySize costs a factor of seven.
#   .axisKind      — 1 both bounds movable; 2 the histogram's frequency axis,
#                    whose floor is a hard 0 inside the draw procedure.
#
# Output:
#   .apply   — 1 if the caller should redraw on (.yMin, .yMax)
#   .yMin, .yMax — the expanded axis
#   .corner$ — the corner the room was made for
#   .heightInches — the laid-out legend box height that was measured
#
# HONESTY. .yMin only ever falls and .yMax only ever rises. The mapping from
# a value to a position on the panel is recomputed from the new bounds by the
# same code that computed it from the old ones; no datum moves relative to
# the axis it is read against. A figure of positive values whose legend sits
# in a bottom corner can end up with a negative axis floor, and that is the
# honest outcome — it is empty axis, exactly as the empty axis above a
# bracket stack is, and the alternative is a key printed over the data.

# hand-transcribed copy of this sequence is worth nothing: it tests the copy,
# and passes however far the shipped block drifts from it.
#
# NO PARAMETERS, and reads and writes main-body scope, exactly as
# @emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom does. That is not a compromise forced by
# Praat: a bare name assigned inside a procedure IS the global of that name,
# so every assignment below behaves precisely as it did when these lines sat
# inline. Passing sixteen globals in and out would be a larger edit with more

    # value-identical blocks in the exported CSV: 18 rows on the first save,
    # 162 on the ninth, with no draw index to tell them apart -- one analysis,
    # presented as nine results. The mirror image, an init inside the loop,
    # throws away every pass but the last; validate/v57 pins that case for the
    # multi-column normality Save.
    #
    # The other annotated arms get theirs from layering: @emlReportBridgeStats
    # opens with @emlCSVInit, so the five bridge calls above reset the
    # collector as they report. The scatter does not go through the bridge --
    # @emlDrawScatterPlot calls @emlReportCorrelationAnalysis and
    # @emlReportRegressionAnalysis directly, once for the whole table and again
    # per group -- so its init is here.
    #
    # THE PRESS IS HERE, which is why the init is here and not in the draw
    # layer: the draw procedure is called once per PASS, and a figure whose
    # legend needs y-axis room is dispatched twice for one press
    # (@emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom). An init in the drawing procedure would
    # therefore also be an init per pass -- correct by accident today, wrong
    # the moment a second pass reports anything.
    #
    # THE CONDITION IS NOT `annotate = 1` ALONE, and the difference matters.
    # A Draw that reports nothing must leave the buffer ALONE: on the
    # wrapper -> Draw journey it holds the analysis the user just ran and the
    # Save panel offers it. The scatter reports only when it has been asked for
    # a correlation or a regression, which is exactly scatterAnalysisType > 0 --
    # the same value the draw procedure branches on.
    #
    # @emlCSVInitRows AND NOT @emlCSVInit, AND THAT IS NOT A HEDGE. @emlCSVInit
    # also zeroes emlResult_declared, deliberately: it is the one place that can
    # guarantee the three-file flag describes the analysis about to run rather
    # than a previous one. Every path that clears it goes on to DECLARE, which
    # is what @emlReportBridgeStats does on the five bridge arms above. The
    # scatter's reporters do not declare -- @emlReportCorrelationAnalysis and
    # @emlReportRegressionAnalysis emit rows and nothing else -- so clearing
    # the flag here would not correct a stale declaration, it would delete a
    # live one: the wrapper -> annotated-scatter journey would stop writing
    # tidy and glance and fall back to the legacy single file, which is a
    # second export defect traded for the first. What this press owns is its
    # ROWS, and its rows are what it resets. Which of the two results should
    # win when a wrapper's analysis and a figure's annotation disagree is an
    # open design question about the bridge and is not decided here.
    #
    # THE PROCEDURE LIVES IN stats/eml-output.praat, which owns the collector.
    # Saving and restoring emlResult_declared here instead would put migration
    # state in this file: ONE FILE MAY BRANCH ON MIGRATION STATE, and this is
