# ============================================================================
# EML Stats : Analysis Orchestrators
# ============================================================================
# Module: eml-analysis.praat
# Version: 1.3
# Date: 8 August 2026
#
#
# Purpose: Centralizes computation + reporting for all analysis types.
#          Each orchestrator: validate → compute → report.
#
# Reporters live in eml-annotation-procedures.praat (existing) except
# for two NEW reporters defined here:
#   @emlReportPairwiseComparison  — extracted from eml-pairwise.praat
#   @emlReportDescriptiveAnalysis — extracted from eml-describe-table.praat
#
# Dependencies (must be included before this file):
#   eml-core-utilities.praat
#   eml-core-descriptive.praat
#   eml-extract.praat
#   eml-output.praat
#   eml-inferential.praat
#
# Reporters called by orchestrators are defined in files included
# AFTER this one (eml-annotation-procedures.praat). Praat resolves
# all procedure names at parse time, so forward references work.

# ============================================================================
# The key travels through the plugin lowercase ("bonferroni", "holm", "bh")
# because that is what @emlPairwiseT, @emlHolm and R's p.adjust all accept.
# Interpolating it straight into a report heading produced
#   Pairwise Welch t-test (bonferroni adjustment)
# which matches neither the "Bonferroni" the user picked in the optionmenu
# nor any way a reader would write Benjamini-Hochberg.
#
# This is DISPLAY ONLY. Nothing may branch on .name$ — the lowercase key
# stays canonical everywhere a comparison is made.
#
# NAME. The obvious name @emlAdjustMethodName is already defined in
# graphs/eml-graphs-form.praat, where it maps an optionmenu INDEX to the
# lowercase key. Praat resolves a duplicated procedure name to whichever
# definition it meets first, and scripts/eml-lib.praat includes THIS file
# before eml-graphs-form.praat — so defining that name here would silently
# capture the graphs form's integer calls and pass a number into a string
# parameter. Hence the distinct name.
#
# Arguments:
#   .key$  — "bonferroni", "holm" or "bh" (surrounding space tolerated)
# Output:

# THE POLICY THIS BELONGS TO. A post-hoc the user chose runs on every door,
# whatever the omnibus says (punch list 2026-08-25, lane 3.1). Four sites used
# to decide otherwise and three of them took the post-hoc away in silence.
# Running it is the ruling; this line is what the ruling owes the reader when
# the omnibus did not reach the level in force — a pairwise result read out of
# a family the omnibus could not separate deserves the caveat, and the caveat
# is a sentence rather than a missing table.
#
# ROUTED AS AN EXPLANATION, deliberately, and the language batch says why
# (item 11): the FACT is the omnibus p, and that number is printed on every
# path by the report above this line, so nothing the reader needs rides on a
# line the explanations toggle can remove. Compare @emlEffectMatrixCaption
# below, whose first half is a DISCLOSURE for exactly the opposite reason.
#
# THE LEVEL IS THE ALPHA IN FORCE, never a literal: @emlReportAlpha is the
# report's one answer to "significant against what", and the leading zero is
# dropped the way every other level and p-value in the tree drops it. A run at

# ============================================================================
# The effect-size matrix prints whether or not a post-hoc ran; with the
# post-hoc off it is the only pairwise thing in the report, and an unlabelled
# grid of numbers under a heading that says "pairwise" invites being read as
# significance. Two sentences, and the language batch (item 12) splits them by
# routing on purpose:
#
#   * "No pairwise significance tests were run" is a DISCLOSURE. It states what
#     was NOT computed, so it prints on every path — a toggle must not be able
#     to remove it.
#   * "Effect sizes estimate the size of each pairwise difference" is an
#     EXPLANATION. It teaches what the numbers are, and where explanations are
#     off it is absent rather than shortened.
#
# UNCORRECTED PAIRWISE p-VALUES ARE NEVER SHOWN HERE, and that is the standing
# rule this caption sits under (lane 3.4): if a bare-LSD pairwise test is ever
# added it must bring its own omnibus gate with it.
#
# emlPairwiseFollows IS HOW A CALLER SAYS "NOT YET", and it exists because one
# door runs its omnibus and its post-hoc as two calls. The wizard's Scheffe and
# pairwise-Welch rows ask @emlRunAnovaAnalysis for an ANOVA with NO Tukey, and
# then ask @emlRunPairwiseAnalysis for the post-hoc the user actually chose --
# so at the moment this caption is reached, `no pairwise significance tests
# were run` is true of the report it sits in and FALSE of the run, and the
# pairwise p-values it denies are eleven lines further down the same Info
# window. A caller that is about to print them raises this flag around the
# omnibus call and lowers it afterwards, the way @emlGraphsWorkflow raises and
# lowers emlShowExplanations for its own scope. Unset means what it says: no
# door but the wizard sets it, and an absent variable reads as 0.

# @emlReportPairwiseComparison
# Extracted from inline code in eml-pairwise.praat.
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THE REPORT CARRIES, AND WHY:
#
#   * n, mean and SD per group, so d is not reported without its inputs.
#   * t and df per pair. For Welch, df is fractional and differs per pair,
#     and without it the result cannot be re-tested.
#   * BOTH the raw and the adjusted p, each labelled, under a heading that
#     names the method.
#   * Significant pairs carry "*", and the alpha that marks them is echoed in
#     the header block and again in the legend.
#   * The Cohen's d matrix is ANTISYMMETRIC, because the sign carries the
#     direction of the difference, and the convention is stated under the
#     matrix that uses it -- read in the same idiom as the symmetric p matrix
#     above, a negative d reads as a negative effect size.
#   * The adjustment method is title-cased for display through
#     @emlAdjustMethodDisplay, so the heading matches the optionmenu.
#   * Table, column and group names print LITERALLY, not underscore-stripped
#     (F0_Hz -> "F0 Hz", demo_3groups -> "demo 3groups"), which would rename
#     the user's data in the one place they need to copy it back out of.
#     Underscore-to-space is a Picture window convention (Rule 28B); it does
#     not belong in plain text that names something the user has to type or
#     select.
#
# Arguments:
#   .tableId — the table the test ran on. Required for the per-group
#              descriptives, which re-read the column.
#
# Output (welch/student branch only; DARK -- computed, never printed):
#   .meanDiffFlat# — mean difference per pair, C(k,2) length, in the same
#                    pair order as .rawP# / .adjustedP#. Computed on every
#                    row regardless of correction, per Fable's 26 August
#                    work order, but not yet reported: the language it
#                    would print is drafted and gated on Ian's en-bloc
#                    approval (docs/RULING_INTERVALS_2026-08-26.md).
#   .lowFlat#, .highFlat# — the interval per pair, or undefined where the
#                    correction in force does not define one. Populated
#                    only when .adjMethod$ is "bonferroni" (level
#                    1 - alpha/m per pair); undefined for holm and bh,
#                    which define no such level. Not yet reported, for the
#                    same reason as .meanDiffFlat# above.
#
# Output (wilcoxon branch only; DARK -- computed, never printed):
#   .hlEstFlat#    — the Hodges-Lehmann shift estimate per pair, C(k,2)
#                    long, in @emlPairwiseWilcoxon's own pair order.
#                    Computed on every row under every correction, per
#                    the same 26 August work order clause that governs
#                    .meanDiffFlat# above, and printed by nothing: the
#                    line it would print, "Hodges-Lehmann shift
#                    (C1 - C2): x.xx", is drafted and gated on Ian's
#                    en-bloc approval of the language batch
#                    (docs/RULING_INTERVALS_2026-08-26.md).
#   .hlLowFlat#, .hlHighFlat# — that estimate's interval per pair, or
#                    undefined where the correction in force does not
#                    define one. Bonferroni only, at
#                    .level = 1 - alpha/m; undefined under holm and bh.
#   .hlMethod$ [i] — "exact" or "normal approximation" for pair i: WHICH
#                    NULL DISTRIBUTION THAT PAIR'S INTERVAL CAME FROM.
#                    Exposed because it must equal the branch the pair's
#                    p-value was computed on, and a report whose interval
#                    and p-value disagree about that is incoherent while
#                    both numbers still look reasonable. v145 reads it.
#
#   These four are named apart from the welch/student branch's
#   .meanDiffFlat# / .lowFlat# / .highFlat# rather than sharing them.
#   Only one branch of this procedure runs per call, so sharing would
#   compile; it would also let a stale interval from a previous t-branch
#   call be read back as this call's Hodges-Lehmann one, which is a
#   reading error no check would see.

        ; ITEM 3 -- THE HODGES-LEHMANN PLUMBING, BUILT DARK.
        ;
        ; The same rule item 2 wired into the welch/student branch above,
        ; applied to this one (docs/WORK_ORDER_INTERVALS_2026-08-26.md):
        ; the POINT ESTIMATE on every row under every correction, and the
        ; INTERVAL only where the correction in force defines a level --
        ; Bonferroni at 1 - alpha/m per pair. Holm and BH define none, so
        ; .hlLowFlat# / .hlHighFlat# stay undefined on those runs.
        ;
        ; The estimate here is the Hodges-Lehmann shift, not a mean
        ; difference: this arm ranks, so its location statistic is the
        ; median of the cross-differences, and @emlHodgesLehmannTwoSample
        ; takes the branch -- exact or normal approximation --
        ; @emlMannWhitneyU took on the same two vectors, by the same gate
        ; copied verbatim from it. .hlMethod$ records which, so a check
        ; can confirm the interval and the p-value are on the same
        ; distribution.
        ;
        ; WHY THE PROCEDURE IS CALLED ON EVERY ROW AND NOT ONLY ON
        ; BONFERRONI ONES. The estimate and the interval come out of one
        ; call -- unlike the t branch, where the mean difference was
        ; already sitting in @emlPairwiseT's .diffMatrix## and only the
        ; interval needed computing. The work order's own instruction for
        ; this is "compute-then-conditionally-print ... the branch is one
        ; if at the print site", so the call is made with the Bonferroni
        ; level throughout and the RESULT is what the correction gates.
        ; A Holm run therefore computes an interval and stores it
        ; nowhere, which is the order's shape, not an oversight.
        ;
        ; THE VECTORS ARE RE-READ FROM THE TABLE, through the same
        ; @eml_getGroupData and the same group labels
        ; @emlPairwiseWilcoxon built its matrices from, exactly as
        ; @emlReportPairwiseDescriptives above re-reads them for the
        ; group means. @emlPairwiseWilcoxon keeps matrices, not data, so
        ; there is nothing to inherit.

# @emlRunGroupedRegression -- per-group regression fits beside the overall one
# ============================================================================
# Punch list 4.5 / OPEN_ITEMS "the regression group column" ruling: the
# correlate dialog's per-group block (eml-correlate.praat) is the whole
# pattern this ports. ONE procedure, called from BOTH doors (the menu's
# eml-regress.praat and the wizard's D_PREDICT_COLUMNS page) so the group
# column cannot drift between them the way the two independently-copied
# correlation blocks (menu vs wizard) already have -- the DRY law in
# CLAUDE.md ("state the canon once in a procedure").
#
# PRECONDITION: called immediately after @emlRunRegressionAnalysis has
# succeeded for the WHOLE table and nothing else has run in between --
# emlLinearRegression.* still holds the OVERALL fit, exactly the assumption
# @emlReportRegressionAnalysis itself already makes. The overall coefficients
# are read into this procedure's own dotted locals in its first lines, before
# anything below re-invokes @emlLinearRegression on a group's data and
# overwrites those globals -- the same hazard @emlDeclareRegressionResult's
# comment documents for @emlBridgeGroupComparison.
#
# Two passes over the groups, for the reason @emlCountGroups is called before
# any group prints: pass 1 only counts complete pairs per group, so the block
# is announced with its own header and counts before any group's report
# appears, and the groups too small to fit (n < 3, the same floor
# @emlLinearRegression itself enforces) are named on ONE summary line rather
# than costing an orphan line each.
#
# ONE export, not one per group: tidy is rebuilt (glance's overall row
# survives) with EVERY row labelled in `term` -- "(overall) (Intercept)" /
# "(overall) <predictor>" for the whole-table fit, "<group> = <level>
# (Intercept)" / "<group> = <level> <predictor>" per group -- so a reader of
# the export can tell which fit each row belongs to without re-deriving it.
# n.groups records how many per-group fits are in tidy, the same field the
# grouped correlation export already writes.
#
# The legacy CSV buffer's per-group additions (made by the calls into
# @emlReportRegressionAnalysis below, which also feed the legacy writer) are
# truncated back to the overall analysis afterwards -- same restore
# eml-correlate.praat's own per-group block performs, and for the same
# reason: the legacy buffer has no group column to carry the label in.
#
# Arguments:
#   .tableId    -- the Table object
#   .tableName$ -- for the per-group report's "Table" field and Info titles
#   .predCol$   -- predictor (X) column name
#   .respCol$   -- response (Y) column name
#   .groupCol$  -- grouping column name (caller has already confirmed this
#                  is neither .predCol$ nor .respCol$)
#
# Outputs:
#   .pgTotal, .pgRun, .pgSkipped -- group counts, for a caller that wants
#                                   them (e.g. a flow-invariant or coverage
#                                   check); the Info report already states

# @emlNormalityRecommendation
# ============================================================================
# THE normality decision rule. This procedure is the ONLY place in the plugin
# where the hierarchy and its thresholds are written down.
#
# @wizardNormDiag (scripts/eml-wizard.praat) and the per-group branch of
# scripts/eml-check-normality.praat call it rather than carrying copies.
# Three copies of a rule is three chances to drift -- hard-coded thresholds
# against the shared constants, or an older gate on one path only, and ONE
# wrapper then gives two different answers for the same data depending on
# whether the user picked a grouping column. This is one copy with three
# callers.
#
# THE HIERARCHY
#
# SHAPIRO-WILK IS THE TEST. Skewness and kurtosis are descriptive statistics,
# not tests. They are the backup — they decide only where Shapiro-Wilk cannot
# — plus the one large-n override below.
#
#   Shapiro-Wilk usable and rejects (p < 0.05)
#       shape not severe and n > 50  → parametric  (large-n override)
#       otherwise                    → nonparametric
#   Shapiro-Wilk usable, does not reject
#                                    → parametric. Severe shape is REPORTED
#                                      by the caller but does not overturn a
#                                      formal test. Shapiro-Wilk is the most
#                                      powerful of the common omnibus
#                                      normality tests across a broad range
#                                      of alternatives (Razali & Wah 2011); a
#                                      rule of thumb does not outvote it.
#   Shapiro-Wilk unusable            → shape decides, and this is the ONLY
#                                      branch in which it decides anything.
#
# The large-n override exists because Shapiro-Wilk rejects departures too
# small to matter for a parametric test once n is large.
#
# Arguments:
#   .skewness — sample skewness
#   .kurtosis — EXCESS kurtosis (0 = normal), not raw kurtosis
#   .n        — count the statistics were computed on (non-missing values)
#   .swP      — @emlShapiroWilk's .p. MAY BE undefined; see the note below.
#   .swError$ — @emlShapiroWilk's .error$; "" means the test produced a p
#
# Output:
#   .recommendation$ — "parametric" or "nonparametric"
#   .swUsable        — 1 when Shapiro-Wilk produced a p-value
#   .swFail          — 1 when Shapiro-Wilk ran AND rejected (p < 0.05)
#   .shapeSevere     — 1 when |skew| >= emlSkewThreshold or
#                      |excess kurtosis| >= emlKurtosisThreshold
#   .largeNOverride  — 1 when Shapiro-Wilk rejected but shape is within
#                      limits at n > 50, so the answer is parametric anyway
#
# This procedure is PURE DECISION. It prints nothing, declares no result
# object, touches no global and selects no object, so the wizard can call it
# without disturbing wizard state. Callers own every message; they select it
# from the flags above rather than re-deriving the rule.
#
# Thresholds are emlSkewThreshold / emlKurtosisThreshold (stats/
# eml-output.praat), the same constants the printed verdicts use, so the gate
# and the prose cannot disagree.
#
# UNDEFINED .swP IS EXPECTED, NOT AN ERROR. @emlShapiroWilk initialises .p to
# undefined and leaves it there whenever it sets .error$ (n < 3, n > 5000,
# zero range). The .swUsable test is therefore NESTED, not `and`-ed: Praat
# does not short-circuit `and`, so `.swError$ = "" and .swP < 0.05` evaluates
# the comparison against undefined on every call. Do not "simplify" it back.

#
# INIT ONCE PER PRESS, ACCUMULATE PER LOOP.
#
# scripts/eml-check-normality.praat tests EVERY numeric column in one press of
# Run: one `for iSel from 1 to nNumericCols` loop, one call to
# @emlRunNormalityAnalysis per column, then one Save. An orchestrator that
# cleared the collectors at its own entry would have each pass of that loop
# wipe the pass before it, and Save would write the LAST column only -- with
# the report still carrying all three columns and the tidy frame carrying one
# row, numerically perfect and quietly short.
#
# It cannot be "clear at the wrapper instead": the wrapper's per-press
# hook would be a line in scripts/eml-check-normality.praat, and the wizard
# reaches the same orchestrator with no loop at all. So the boundary is
# detected here, from state that is already maintained, and every clause below
# is a way for a call to be the FIRST of a press rather than the second:
#
#   .testType$ = "single"   the wizard's literal, at eml-wizard.praat:1698.
#                           That page runs one column per press and offers
#                           Save on each; two presses must not merge. This is
#                           the one place the third argument is read.
#   no press open           emlNorm_n is this procedure's own record of the
#                           press in flight. Zero or absent means there is no
#                           press to join. NOT emlResult_declared: v46 pins
#                           that only stats/eml-output.praat may branch on the
#                           migration flag, one decision point for one
#                           question, and this is a different question asked
#                           in a different file. The press keeps its own
#                           state rather than borrowing that one.
#   a different analysis    an ANOVA ran in between; its frames are not ours.
#   a different table       the user changed objects.
#   emlReportAnalysis$ set  @emlHandleCommonFields sets it on EVERY Run, in
#                           every wrapper, and @emlReportHeader consumes it on
#                           the first report printed. So it is non-empty at
#                           the top of column 1 and empty at the top of column
#                           2 -- the once-per-Run signal, already in the tree
#                           for report provenance, and the only one that
#                           survives Save/New.
#   the column repeats      belt and braces: a second press over the same
#                           column list starts with a column already held.
#
# Praat evaluates BOTH operands of `and`, so these are nested ifs, not one
# conjunction: none of these globals exists until something has set it.

# WHAT A REFUSAL IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM.
#
# The repeated-measures and Friedman paths drop a row unless every condition
# cell in it is present -- listwise, because per-column deletion would break
# the within-subject pairing. The SUCCESS path discloses that in the
# "row(s) excluded for missing data" note printed under the results, and the
# REFUSAL path has to disclose it too, because the refusal text is a claim
# about the very population that was reduced:
#
#   "The subject x condition residual is zero: every subject shows exactly
#    the same pattern across conditions."
#
# Undisclosed, that sentence is true of the subjects that survived listwise
# deletion and says nothing about the ones that did not: a reader is told a
# fact about "every subject" over half a table, with no indication that the
# other half was ever there. The arithmetic is right and the sentence is not.
#
# The wording follows describe's -- "N excluded 3 · 3 cell(s) empty (row 3
# first). Treated as missing data." -- because two disclosure styles for one
# condition is how a reader learns to skip both. @emlAuditColumn's per-column
# note is carried through verbatim, so the row numbers a user would go and
# look at are the ones they are given.
#
# ONE PARAGRAPH, NO NEWLINES. This string reaches @emlErrorDialog, which
# hands it to @emlWrapText at 62 columns; an embedded newline would survive
# into a `comment:` line and print as a control character rather than a break.
#
# ASCII ONLY, and this is the one place the wording departs from describe's.
# Describe's disclosure carries a middle dot -- "N excluded 3 · 3 cell(s)
# empty (row 3 first)." -- and that separator cannot be used here. The
# string is appended to an orchestrator's .error$, and .error$ is passed
# to @emlRecordAnalysisStep as the refusal note for the step, which is written
# into a RECORDED SCRIPT. Praat writes a text file as UTF-16 the moment its
# content contains one non-ASCII character, so a session that hit this refusal

# @emlDeclareOneWayAnovaResult
# ============================================================================
# Declare a completed one-way ANOVA in broom's three-file shape, so the export
# surface can write tidy / glance / augment instead of one wide file.
#
# WHY THE SPLIT IS THREE FILES AND NOT ONE
#
# broom's three verbs answer three different questions and have three
# different row counts, which is exactly why they cannot share a table:
#
#   tidy()     one row per model TERM        (here: the factor, and Residuals)
#   glance()   one row for the MODEL         (r.squared, AIC, nobs, ...)
#   augment()  one row per OBSERVATION       (.fitted, .resid, .std.resid)
#
# A single wide file has to pick one of those row counts and pad or repeat for
# the other two, which is what the old exporter did.
#
# TukeyHSD and the effect sizes are SEPARATE MODEL OBJECTS in R --
# tidy(TukeyHSD(fit)) and effectsize::eta_squared(fit) each return their own
# frame, and base aov carries neither. Keeping them out of the two files above
# is what makes those two comparable with broom's own output rather than
# merely broom-flavoured. They are written as their own tidy files.
#
# Called by @emlRunAnovaAnalysis AFTER the reporter, so emlOneWayAnova.* holds
# the values that were actually printed.
#
# Input:
#   .tableName$ - name of the source Table, for the file base name
#   .dataCol$   - measure column
#   .groupCol$  - factor column
#   .tableId    - the Table, for augment
#   .doTukey    - whether post-hoc contrasts were run
#
# Output:
#   emlResult_* collectors, ready for @emlResultWrite / @emlResultWriteTidy
#   .extraTidy$ - newline-separated base names of the additional tidy frames

    ; `.std.resid` is NOT resid / sigma. broom's augment(aov) returns
    ; rstandard(), which is e_i / (s * sqrt(1 - h_i)); the regression arm gets
    ; that from @emlOLSInfluence, and the ANOVA arms have to publish the same
    ; quantity under R's name. Dropping the leverage term costs a uniform
    ; 4.4% understatement on a balanced two-way design (1 / sqrt(1 - 1/12) =
    ; 1.044466) and a per-observation one that grows with leverage as soon as
    ; the design is unbalanced.
    ;
    ; No hat matrix has to be formed. A one-way ANOVA fits one mean per group,
    ; so the fitted value of an observation is its own group's mean and the
    ; leverage is exactly 1 / n_group -- the projection onto a group-indicator
    ; basis, computed here from the count the glance frame already used. Same
    ; identity, same arithmetic, no linear algebra.
    ;
    ; `.hat` is in emlVocabAugment$, so the leverage that does the correcting
    ; is in the file beside the corrected value. A column NOT in the
    ; vocabulary would be dropped by @eml_orderedCols in silence rather than
    ; refused, which is why the vocabulary entry is stated rather than
    ; assumed.
    ;
    ; A group of one has leverage 1, so its standardised residual is 0/0.
    ; @emlOneWayAnova refuses that case before reaching here (a group needs at
    ; least 2 observations), but the guard is written anyway: an empty cell

# ============================================================================
#  BROOM-SHAPE DECLARATIONS FOR THE REMAINING ORCHESTRATORS
# ============================================================================
# Each @emlDeclare* below is called by its orchestrator AFTER the analysis has
# run, and fills the tidy / glance / augment collectors in eml-result-writer.
#
# THREE RULES THESE ALL FOLLOW, EACH FOR A REASON FOUND THE HARD WAY:
#
# 1. Gate on `.error$ = ""`, never on "is the value defined". Praat globals
#    persist across invocations, so a guard path leaves the PREVIOUS run's
#    numbers sitting in the namespace. Declaring on definedness would export
#    the last analysis's result under this one's name.
#
# 2. Stage the extra frames BEFORE the model frames. Staging reuses the one
#    tidy collector, so the model's own tidy has to be the last thing left in
#    it when @emlResultWrite runs.
#
# 3. Do not read a namespace that a later procedure re-enters. @emlRankBiserialR
#    re-runs @emlMannWhitneyU, @emlMatchedPairsR re-runs @emlWilcoxonSignedRank,
#    @emlDunnTest re-runs both. Read the outer values first or use the
#    orchestrator's own restored locals.
#
# SHAPE NOTE. broom has no augment() for htest objects -- there is no model to
# fit values from -- so the two-group, paired, correlation, KW, normality and
# Friedman declarations emit tidy and glance only. That is broom's shape, not
# an omission, and @emlResultWrite reports the absent augment as skipped
# rather than writing an empty file.
# ============================================================================


# --- 2. Two independent groups ---------------------------------------------
# tidy(t.test) is ONE row: estimate (the mean difference), estimate1,
# estimate2, statistic, p.value, parameter (df), method, alternative. There is
# no `term`. When the wrapper runs both families, one row per family is
# emitted and `method` is what distinguishes them -- an extension of broom's
# shape rather than a departure from it, since broom would produce two frames.

# --- 8b. Descriptives ------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIBE AND NORMALITY CAN SAVE. Every analysis that produces results a
# user can read produces results a user can keep.
#
# THE LEGACY BUFFER, NOT THE BROOM COLLECTORS, and this is the interesting
# part. Declaring into tidy/glance like every other converted analysis would
# silently throw the answer away: eml-result-writer.praat's tidy vocabulary
# is a WHITELIST walked by
# @eml_orderedCols, so a column not in emlVocabTidy$ is dropped without
# comment -- and mean, sd, se, median, q1, q3, iqr, min, max, range,
# variance, skewness and kurtosis are none of them broom column names,
# because broom has no tidy method for a summary of a vector. The written
# file would have carried `term` and `method` and nothing else.
#
# TWO OF THE SIXTEEN ARE TIDY COLUMNS -- emlVocabTidy$ carries skewness and
# kurtosis for the normality frame -- so the arithmetic above is `term`,
# `skewness`, `kurtosis` and `method`, and eleven of the sixteen still go over
# the side without a word. That does not move the conclusion an inch, and the
# reason it does not is worth stating: a whitelist that has grown by two is
# not a whitelist that has stopped dropping things, and a describe declared
# into tidy would still lose the mean.
#
# That is a reason not to convert describe, and not a reason describe cannot
# export: the legacy long format (table, analysis, term, term_type, field,
# value) is the container built for a heterogeneous bag of named scalars, and
# it takes all sixteen without inventing a single non-broom column name. See

# "Descriptive statistics" -- not the table. Got this backwards on the first

# --- 9. Normality ----------------------------------------------------------
# Reads emlRunNormalityAnalysis.* -- the one orchestrator that copies every
# value onto itself, so nothing here depends on procedure-global survival.
#
# ACCUMULATION IS A REPLAY, NOT AN APPEND.
#
# Skipping @emlResultBegin on a continuation and letting @emlTidyRow append
# does not work, and the reason is the GLANCE frame: it holds exactly one row,
# already filled with column 1's W, p, skewness and kurtosis, and the result
# writer offers a tidy-only clear (@emlTidyClear) and no glance-only clear.
# Appending would fix the tidy frame and leave glance asserting one unnamed
# column's statistics over a three-column run.
#
# So the press keeps its own record, in emlNorm_*, and EVERY call re-declares
# the whole press from it. @emlResultBegin then runs on every call as it
# always did, the collectors are never half-written, and the glance decision
# is taken knowing how many columns the press holds rather than guessing on
# the first one.
#
# WHAT THE GLANCE ROW SAYS WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MODEL. broom has no
# answer to this -- you would map glance() over the models and rbind -- and
# emlVocabGlance$ has no `term`, so a per-column identifier cannot be added
# from here (the vocabulary is a whitelist in eml-result-writer.praat, and a
# column not in it is dropped by @eml_orderedCols without a word). The row
# therefore carries only what is true OF THE RUN: the method, a `warning` that
# names the columns and says where the per-column numbers are, and nobs /
# n.excluded / alternative when every column agrees on them and nothing at all
# when they do not.
#
# THE SHAPE STATISTICS ARE NOT IN THAT ROW BUT THEY ARE IN THE FILE. skewness
# and kurtosis are tidy columns, one pair per row, declared in the loop below.
# "The vocabulary does not have it" would not have been a reason to leave them
# out of any file -- the whitelist is ours. The `warning` still says the
# recommendation is in the report, because a recommendation is a sentence and
# there is no column of any vocabulary it belongs in.

    ; alternative is the glance frame, which on more than one model carries
    ; only what is true OF THE RUN -- so a one-column press would export them
    ; and a two-column press would export them nowhere, leaving the shape
    ; statistics for column 2 in the Info window and in no file at all. That
    ; asymmetry gets worse the more columns a user tests, which is the wrong
    ; direction for an export to fail in.
    ; validate/v64_display_and_coercion.R measures it.
    ;
    ; OUTSIDE THE ERROR BRANCH, DELIBERATELY, and the branch's own comment below
    ; is the argument: a column whose n puts Shapiro-Wilk out of range still has
    ; a skewness and a kurtosis, and those are the whole of what the analysis
    ; found. Emitting them only on the branch that ALSO has a W would drop them
    ; from exactly the rows that have nothing else in them.
    ;
    ; THEY ARE UNDEFINED BELOW n = 3 AND n = 4 RESPECTIVELY (@emlSkewness,
    ; @emlKurtosis, stats/eml-core-descriptive.praat), and @emlTidyNum writes
    ; nothing for an undefined value, so those cells stay empty and R reads NA.
