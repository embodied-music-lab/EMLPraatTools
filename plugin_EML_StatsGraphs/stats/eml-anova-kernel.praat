# EML Stats : Two-Way ANOVA Kernel
# ============================================================================
# Module: eml-anova-kernel.praat
# Version: 1.0
# Date: 1 September 2026
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Praat's built-in `Report two-way anova` computes the
# main-effect and interaction sums of squares by Khuri's (1998) unweighted-
# means method, and recovers Error by SUBTRACTING those sums from a Total
# centred on the unweighted mean of the cell means. That subtraction is only
# valid when the design is balanced or proportional. Measured on Praat's own
# manual example (Peterson-Barney 1952, F0 by Vowel x Type, a proportional
# but unbalanced design): the built-in reports SS_Error = 1,600,534 where the
# correct within-cell value is 914,449, and a Vowel F of 7.625 where the
# correct value is 13.346 -- and on a genuinely NON-proportional design
# Khuri's own EFFECT sums also disagree with Type I/II/III (all three of
# which agree with each other on a proportional design, and generally do not
# on a non-proportional one). See
# mailbox/to-opus/RULING_CONSOLIDATED_KERNELS_2026-09-01.md section 1
# (Class C) and section 2 for the ruling this file answers.
#
# This module computes the two-way table DIRECTLY from raw data -- no call
# to `Report two-way anova` anywhere in this file -- for all of Type I,
# Type II and Type III sums of squares, selectable, default Type III. It is
# a standalone kernel: nothing here is wired into any menu, dialog, or
# orchestrator (eml-inferential.praat / eml-analysis.praat). That wiring is
# later, separate work.
#
# THE ARITHMETIC, IN PLAIN TERMS.
#
#   Type I  (sequential): fit intercept, then + A, then + B, then + A:B, in
#            that order; each effect's SS is the drop in residual SS (RSS)
#            when it is added. Depends on entry order for the two mains;
#            the interaction is always entered last regardless of type.
#   Type II (each main effect adjusted for the OTHER main effect, never for
#            the interaction): SS_A = RSS(B) - RSS(A+B),
#            SS_B = RSS(A) - RSS(A+B). Order-independent.
#   Type III (each effect adjusted for everything else, including the
#            interaction): computed here as a Wald quadratic form directly
#            on the UNWEIGHTED cell means, per the ruling --
#              v# = solve# (LDL'##, Lmu#)
#              SS  = inner (Lmu#, v#)
#            where mu# is the vector of the r*s cell means, L is a
#            (df x r*s) contrast matrix picking out the effect (sum-to-zero
#            contrasts, matching R's contr.sum), and D = diag(1/n_ij) is the
#            variance shape of the cell means (up to the common sigma^2,
#            which cancels out of the SS entirely -- D never carries an
#            estimate of it). NEVER an explicit inverse: `inverse##` does
#            not exist in Praat 6.6.30 and would be worse-conditioned than
#            the linear solve even where it does. This is mathematically
#            the same definition SAS/car use for Type III (the general
#            linear hypothesis on a full-rank, sum-to-zero-coded model),
#            specialised to the two-way cell-means parameterisation, which
#            is exactly saturated (1 + (r-1) + (s-1) + (r-1)(s-1) = r*s
#            parameters for r*s cells) -- so this is not an approximation
#            of Type III, it IS Type III.
#   Types I and II above are computed the same way car::Anova would get
#   them for a two-factor model with an interaction: by RSS differences of
#   nested OLS fits on a sum-coded (contr.sum) design matrix, via the
#   normal equations (X'X) beta = X'y, solved with `solve#` -- again never
#   an explicit inverse. y is centred on its grand mean first; every model
#   fit here carries an intercept, so RSS is unchanged by that shift, and
#   it keeps the (X'X)/(X'y) products near the scale of the data's spread
#   rather than its raw magnitude.
#   Error:  SS_E = sum over cells of within-cell squared deviations
#           (equivalently sum(y^2) - sum_ij T_ij^2/n_ij; computed here via
#           the centred form for the same reason eml-inferential.praat's
#           own two-way path gives for choosing it -- numerical stability).
#           df_E = N - r*s.
#   Total:  SS_T = sum(y^2) - T^2/N, i.e. squared deviations about the
#           ordinary OBSERVATION-WEIGHTED grand mean -- not the unweighted
#           mean of the cell means. That substitution is the bug being
#           fixed here. df_T = N - 1.
#   F, p:   each effect's mean square (SS/df) against MS_Error, referred to
#           fisherQ. Error is the same for all three SS types -- only the
#           effect sums differ by type.
#   Effect sizes: partial eta^2 = SS_effect / (SS_effect + SS_Error);
#           eta^2 = SS_effect / SS_Total; omega^2 (Field 2013) =
#           (SS_effect - df_effect * MS_Error) / (SS_Total + MS_Error).
#   Levene: a standard Brown-Forsythe/Levene test (median-centred), grouped
#           by the r*s cells (the interaction of both factors) -- the same
#           grouping car::leveneTest(y ~ A*B) uses by default.
#   Shapiro-Wilk: run on the ANOVA residuals (y_ijk - cell mean_ij) through
#           the plugin's OWN existing @emlShapiroWilk
#           (eml-core-descriptive.praat) -- not a second implementation.
#
# SCOPE, EXPLICITLY. This file computes the omnibus table: SS/df/MS/F/p for
# both main effects and the interaction (Types I, II, III, all three always
# computed; the requested type controls which one is reported as the
# headline table), the three effect sizes, Levene's test, Shapiro-Wilk on
# the residuals, and an explicit balance statement. It also computes the
# UNWEIGHTED estimated marginal means and their standard errors/confidence
# intervals (@emlAnovaKernelTwoWayEMM), post hoc pairwise comparisons on
# those marginal means with a selectable adjustment (@emlAnovaKernelTwoWay
# PostHoc), and simple effects -- the effect of one factor at each level of
# the other, against the POOLED error term (@emlAnovaKernelTwoWaySimpleEffects)
# -- per section 2 of the ruling this file answers. All three reuse the same
# r*s cell means and counts @eml_ak2_gather already collects for Type III
# (.cellMean#, .cellN#), and the simple-effects procedure reuses the very
# same Wald-quadratic-form machinery Type III uses (@eml_ak2_typeIIIeffect),
# just with an L matrix that picks out one row or column of the cell-mean
# table instead of a whole main effect -- exactly the reuse this file's
# own prior scope note predicted would make an EMM step "not an awkward"
# addition. Post hoc's Bonferroni/Holm/Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments call
# the plugin's existing @emlBonferroni/@emlHolm/@emlBenjaminiHochberg
# (eml-inferential.praat) rather than reimplementing them; its Tukey leg
# calls the validated studentized-range port (@emlStudentizedRangeQ /
# @emlInvStudentizedRangeQ, eml-studentized-range.praat), and its Scheffe
# leg uses the same Praat builtins (fisherQ/invFisherQ)
# @emlScheffeInterval already uses elsewhere in this plugin, generalised
# to the Tukey-Kramer form for the marginal means' unequal variances (see
# @emlAnovaKernelTwoWayPostHoc's own header for the derivation). NEITHER
# THIS FILE NOR ANY NEW PROCEDURE IN IT IS WIRED into any menu, dialog, or
# orchestrator (eml-inferential.praat / eml-analysis.praat) -- that wiring
# remains later, separate work, per the brief this section answers.
#
# COMPLETE DESIGNS ONLY. Every one of the r*s factor-level combinations
# must have at least one observation. An empty cell makes Type III (and
# this file's Type I/II normal-equation solves, which use the same
# saturated, sum-coded design matrix) inestimable in the ordinary sense;
# @eml_ak2_gather refuses with .error$ rather than silently dropping a
# level or producing a singular solve. (Type III with unweighted marginal
# means is meaningful only when every level combination has data to
# average in the first place.)

# @emlAnovaKernelTwoWayEMM
# ============================================================================
# Estimated marginal means (EMMs) for both factors of a two-way design,
# computed directly from raw data -- no fitted model object, same style as
# @emlAnovaKernelTwoWay itself.
#
# THE DEFINITION. Each EMM is the UNWEIGHTED average of the cell means that
# make it up -- factor 1's level i EMM is the average of its s cell means,
# each cell counted once regardless of n_ij; factor 2's level j EMM is the
# average of its r cell means, likewise. This is what R's emmeans computes
# by default (weights = "equal") for a two-way lm with an interaction, and
# it is deliberately the SAME hypothesis Type III's main-effect contrasts
# test -- @eml_ak2_buildL's own header already notes its 1/s and 1/r
# averaging factors exist for exactly this reason. A Type III table without
# these means leaves the user unable to interpret what the test found; that
# is why this procedure exists.
#
# THE STANDARD ERROR. Var(EMM_i) = msError * (1/s^2) * sum_j (1/n_ij) for
# factor 1 (symmetrically for factor 2, with r in place of s) -- the
# variance of an unweighted average of independent cell means, each with
# variance sigma^2/n_ij, using the pooled error mean square msError = SS
# Error / dfError as the estimate of sigma^2 (the same error term, and the
# same dfError = N - rs, that @emlAnovaKernelTwoWay's headline table
# already uses -- an EMM's confidence interval is only comparable to that
# table's F-tests if both rest on the same error term). No covariance term
# is needed between two different levels of the SAME factor: EMM_i and
# EMM_i' are built from entirely disjoint sets of cells, so they are
# independent given the model's homoscedasticity assumption.
#
# Verified against real emmeans 1.10.0 (validate/v156_marginal_means.R):
# on all four kit fixtures, EMM and SE match to the standard tolerance
# (relative 1e-9, absolute 1e-12).
#
# Arguments:
#   .tableId   - ID of a Table object (must be in the object list)
#   .dataCol$  - name of the numeric data column
#   .factor1$  - name of the first factor column (string levels)
#   .factor2$  - name of the second factor column (string levels)
#   .alpha     - 1 - confidence level for the interval (e.g. 0.05 for 95%
#                CIs); must be strictly between 0 and 1
#

# THE DENOMINATOR, A DELIBERATE DEFINITIONAL CHOICE. Every simple-effect F
# here is tested against the POOLED error mean square from the FULL

# term @emlAnovaKernelTwoWay's headline table and @emlAnovaKernelTwoWayEMM
# both use -- NOT a separate error term recomputed from only the rows at
# that one slice. This is the definition R's emmeans::joint_tests(model,
# by = <the other factor>) uses on an `lm` fit of the full model, and it is
# what @eml_ak2_buildLSlice's SS feeds a pooled-.msError F against below.
# It is NOT the only defensible definition -- SPSS's "simple effects" dialog
# offers a level-specific error term as an alternative (refit the error
# variance from only the data at that slice; different df, and a different,
# generally larger, standard error whenever variances differ across cells
# outside the slice) -- but the pooled form is what this procedure computes,
# because it is the one that stays consistent with the omnibus Type III
# table and the EMMs above sharing one error term throughout, and it is

# ============================================================================
# @emlAnovaKernelTwoWayPostHoc
# ============================================================================
# Post hoc pairwise comparisons on ONE factor's estimated marginal means
# (@emlAnovaKernelTwoWayEMM), with a selectable adjustment: Bonferroni,
# Holm, Benjamini-Hochberg, Tukey or Scheffe. Calls the plugin's EXISTING
# adjustment machinery rather than reimplementing it -- @emlBonferroni,
# @emlHolm, @emlBenjaminiHochberg (eml-inferential.praat) for the first
# three; the validated studentized-range port
# (@emlStudentizedRangeQ/@emlInvStudentizedRangeQ, the same port
# @eml_tukeyPairwiseFromGroups calls) for Tukey, and Praat's own
# invFisherQ (the same builtin @emlScheffeInterval already uses
# elsewhere in this plugin) for Scheffe.
#
# THE RAW TEST. Every pairwise comparison of two marginal means is a t-test
# against the pooled error term: t = (EMM_i - EMM_i') / SE_diff, SE_diff =
# sqrt(Var(EMM_i) + Var(EMM_i')) (no covariance term -- the two marginal
# means are built from disjoint sets of cells), df = dfError (the pooled
# model error df, same as the omnibus table and the EMMs). Two-sided raw p
# = 2 * studentQ (abs (t), dfError), the same signed-studentQ idiom
# @emlTTest already uses in this plugin.
#
# THE FIVE METHODS.
#   bonferroni / holm / bh -- the raw t-test p-values above, in (i, j),
#     i < j pair order, handed as one vector to @emlBonferroni / @emlHolm /
#     @emlBenjaminiHochberg and mapped back into the (i, j) matrix.
#   tukey  -- Tukey-Kramer generalisation for unequal marginal-mean
#     variances. In the balanced, single-n case the textbook studentized
#     range statistic is q = |diff| / SE(one mean) = |diff| * sqrt(2) /
#     SE_diff (since SE_diff = sqrt(2) * SE(one mean) when both means share
#     one variance) -- exactly @eml_tukeyPairwiseFromGroups' own .se =
#     sqrt (msWithin * (1/n_i + 1/n_j) / 2) worked backwards. This
#     procedure keeps that same q = |diff| * sqrt(2) / SE_diff relationship
#     but with SE_diff computed from each marginal mean's OWN (possibly
#     unequal, unbalanced-design) variance rather than the single-n
#     formula -- the standard Tukey-Kramer approximation, referred to the
#     studentized range distribution via @emlStudentizedRangeQ/
#     @emlInvStudentizedRangeQ with the family size k = the number of
#     levels in the factor being
#     compared and df = dfError. This is what emmeans' own adjust =
#     "tukey" computes for an unbalanced design.
#   scheffe -- F_Scheffe = (diff / SE_diff)^2 / (k - 1), referred to
#     fisherQ (., k - 1, dfError) -- the same construction
#     @emlScheffeInterval already documents, generalised from a one-way
#     factor's k groups to this factor's k marginal-mean levels.
#
# THE COHERENCE LAW. An interval is printed only when its coverage matches
# the correction in force: Bonferroni prints at level 1 - alpha/m per pair
# (m = the number of pairs in this family); Tukey and Scheffe print their
# own simultaneous interval (both ARE their own correction, at the full
# alpha, per @emlScheffeInterval's own header on why alpha is never
# divided a second time there). Holm and Benjamini-Hochberg define no
# per-pair confidence level at all (their adjustment operates step-wise on
# the ranked p-values, not on a shared per-comparison alpha), so NO
# interval is printed for them -- .lowCI##/.highCI## are left undefined
# rather than silently reusing the raw or Bonferroni interval.
#
# A ZERO OR UNDEFINED PAIRWISE SE (degenerate variance) makes that pair's
# statistic, p-value and interval undefined rather than defaulting to
# p = 1 -- the same fails-closed convention eml_tukeyPairwiseFromGroups'
# own header already documents and justifies.
#
# Verified against real emmeans 1.10.0 pairs()/confint() on every kit
# fixture, all five adjustment methods (validate/v156_marginal_means.R).

# Arguments:
#   .tableId      - ID of a Table object (must be in the object list)

#   .factor1$     - name of the first factor column (string levels)
#   .factor2$     - name of the second factor column (string levels)
#   .factorSelect - 1 -> post hoc on factor 1's marginal means (.emmA#);
#                   2 -> post hoc on factor 2's marginal means (.emmB#)
#   .adjMethod$   - "bonferroni", "holm", "bh", "tukey" or "scheffe"
#                   (lowercase, the same keys @emlBonferroni/@emlHolm/
#                   @emlBenjaminiHochberg and the plugin's own dialogs use)
#   .alpha        - the analysis alpha (e.g. 0.05) -- for bonferroni this
#                   is divided by the pair count for the INTERVAL only (the
#                   p-value correction is @emlBonferroni's own, on the raw
#                   p-values, not a divided alpha); for tukey/scheffe it is
#                   the family-wise alpha their own critical value already
#                   spends in full (never divided again -- see the header
#                   note above)
