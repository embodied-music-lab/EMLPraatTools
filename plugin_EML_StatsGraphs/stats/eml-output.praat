# EML Stats : Output Formatting
# ============================================================================
# Module: eml-output.praat
# Version: 2.4
# Date: 11 May 2026
#
# Part of the EML Stats library (EML Stats & Graphs).
# License: GPL-3.0-or-later
#
# Provides: 60 procedures. THE COUNTING RULE, so the number can be checked
# rather than believed:
#     grep -c "^procedure " plugin/stats/eml-output.praat
# Six of the 60 are private and are named with an underscore after the prefix
# (@eml_csvQuote, @eml_csvAppend, @eml_auditLabelColumn,
# @eml_saveSafeBaseName, @eml_saveFolderWritable, @eml_saveReceiptLines);
# the other 54 are public.
#
# By family:
#
#   Report frame — @emlReportHeader, @emlReportFooter, @emlReportSection,
#     @emlReportLine, @emlReportLineString, @emlReportBlank,
#     @emlReportPWithExact, @emlReportContext, @emlReportNote,
#     @emlReportDescriptiveHeader, @emlReportDescriptiveRow,
#     @emlReportDescriptiveAnalysis, @emlReportAPA, @emlReportToFile,
#     @emlSaveInfoToFile, @emlClearInfo
#   Formatting — @emlFormatP, @emlFormatCI, @emlFormatTestResult,
#     @emlFormatEffectLabel, @emlPadRight, @emlUnderscoreToSpace,
#     @emlWrapText
#   CSV export — @emlCSVInit, @emlCSVSetTable, @emlCSVTermType, @emlCSVAdd,
#     @emlCSVAddStr, @emlCSVAddDescriptives, @emlExportStatsCSV,
#     @emlExportResultFiles
#     (The export is LONG format: emlCSV_header$ is
#     "table,analysis,term,term_type,field,value", and @emlCSVAdd /
#     @emlCSVAddStr each append ONE such row, i.e. one field of one term.
#     There is no procedure that writes a whole analysis in one call.)
#   Wrapper plumbing — @emlWrapperInit, @emlWrapperCommonFields,
#     @emlHandleCommonFields, @eml_auditLabelColumn (private)
#   Saving — @emlSavePanel (the one save journey),
#     with its two entry guards @eml_saveSafeBaseName and
#     @eml_saveFolderWritable and its receipt builder @eml_saveReceiptLines
#     (all three private; the panel owns the naming contract, so the panel
#     owns the characters, the target check and the receipt's line breaks)
#   Wizard glosses — @emlResetExplanations plus the 17 @emlWizardExplain*
#     helpers (grep -c "^procedure emlWizardExplain")
#   Errors — @emlErrorDialog
#
# All procedures use the "eml" prefix (EML Stats).

# When emlShowExplanations = 1, report procedures append value-anchored

# emlWizardExplain$ is set before each @emlReportLine/@emlReportLineString
# call and consumed (cleared) by the procedure.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS 1: a wrapper report explains itself without the user having
# to know that a gate exists. At a default of 0 the glosses would be absent
# from every wrapper report while the graph path (which sets the gate to 1)
# had them — the same analysis narrated two different ways depending on
# whether a figure had been drawn earlier in the session.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS DECLARED ONCE, HERE. @emlResetExplanations restores this
# variable rather than a literal, so the initial value and the restored value
# cannot drift apart.

# Put the explanation gate back to its default (emlShowExplanationsDefault).
#
# @emlGraphsWorkflow raises emlShowExplanations for the drawing path. Left
# raised, it would make every later analysis report in the same session
# verbose, so report content would be ORDER-DEPENDENT: the same analysis
# producing different text depending on whether a figure had been drawn
# earlier.
#
# Any code that raises the gate for its own scope must lower it again through
# this procedure when that scope ends.

# classifier and the sentence the classifier prints cannot drift apart.
#
# THE VALUES ARE 2 AND 7, from West, Finch & Curran (1995), who give
# |skewness| > 2 and |kurtosis| > 7 as indicative of moderate-to-serious
# non-normality. They are explicitly loose guidelines for describing a
# distribution, not a test of it, and that is the only role they have here:
# Shapiro-Wilk decides, and these flag severity. See the interpretation
# block in @emlRunNormalityAnalysis.
#
# A threshold that changes what the plugin recommends has to be attributable,
# which is why the citation is here and not a bare pair of numbers.
#
# To change the house convention, change it here; every consumer reads these.
# Kline's stricter pair for SEM work is 3 and 10.

# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# REPORT PROVENANCE
#
# The Info window appends. That is deliberate (see @emlClearInfo and the
# "Clear Info window" toggle, which persists), but it means one session holds
# several report blocks at once, and a timestamp is not enough to tell two of
# them apart: three Kruskal-Wallis blocks with byte-identical headers can
# report different post-hoc p-values, because the adjustment was changed
# between them.
#
# Two facts settle that, and both belong in the header rather than buried in
# the body, because the header is what a user scrolling back sees:
#
#   emlReportAnalysis$  WHERE this block came from — the analysis dialog, a
#                       graph Draw, the wizard. Titles do not carry this: the
#                       Run and the Draw of one test print the same title.
#   emlReportAdjust$    the correction or adjustment in force for this block
#                       (holm, bonferroni, bh, Tukey HSD, ...). The CSV
#                       already self-documents this, though not in a column
#                       of its own. The schema is
#                       emlCSV_header$ further down this file,
#                       "table,analysis,term,term_type,field,value": the
#                       `analysis` cell names the test, and the adjustment
#                       arrives as an ordinary row whose `field` is
#                       "adjustment" (written by the Dunn's reporter in
#                       graphs/eml-annotation-procedures.praat).
#
# Both are optional. A caller sets them with @emlReportContext immediately
# before @emlReportHeader, and the header CONSUMES them — it prints them and
# clears them. That is the whole discipline, and it is what keeps a stale
# adjustment from a previous post-hoc test appearing on the header of a
# report that has no post-hoc at all. Never read these two directly; never
# leave them set.
#
# @emlHandleCommonFields sets the analysis-dialog origin on every Run, so the
# wrapper path is labelled without any wrapper having to opt in. A block with
# no origin line came from somewhere else — today, a graph Draw.
#
# Cost is one line, and only when there is something to say.

# @eml_fixed: .value, .decimals  ->  .result$        (private)
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# PRAAT'S fixed$ IS NOT A FIXED-PRECISION FORMATTER, and every rounded number
# this plugin prints went through it.
#
# THE HOUSE RULE: no raw double reaches the Info window. Statistics print at
# fixed 4 decimals, p in APA style; full precision belongs to the CSV export,
# which is the file a reader is supposed to compute from. A bare
# `fixed$ (.value, 4)` does not deliver that — it prints
#
#     Skewness            -0.0000000000000001
#
# THE MECHANISM, MEASURED ON 6.6.30 RATHER THAN ASSUMED. fixed$ does not
# format to the precision it is given; it formats to the LARGER of that
# precision and however many decimals are needed to show one significant
# digit. Driven directly:
#
#     fixed$ (-1e-16, 4)  ->  "-0.0000000000000001"     17 decimals, not 4
#     fixed$ (0.0004,  2)  ->  "0.0004"                  4 decimals, not 2
#     fixed$ (0.6,     0)  ->  "0.6"                     1 decimal, not 0
#     fixed$ (0,       4)  ->  "0"                       0 decimals, not 4
#
# So the escape is not a property of skewness, or of the Matrix route, or of
# the Describe wrapper. It is a property of every `fixed$` in the tree, and it
# fires on exactly the values a statistics tool produces most often near zero:
# a skewness of a symmetric column, a t of two identical means, a Cohen's d of
# no difference, a residual mean. Each of those is a genuine zero that
# floating-point arithmetic has left a few ulps away from zero, and each of
# them printed seventeen digits of arithmetic noise where the house standard
# says four. Fixing the one reported line would have left the mechanism, and
# the next symmetric column would have reported it again from somewhere else.
#
# The last row above is the same defect with the opposite sign: an exact zero
# prints as a bare "0" against a column of "1.2910"-shaped neighbours, so the
# one number a reader most wants to recognise at a glance is the one that does
# not line up.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It formats. It never touches a
# computed value: the argument is not modified, nothing is written back, and
# the CSV writers do not call it -- @emlCSVAdd and the three-file writers
# still emit full precision, which is where full precision belongs. The
# rounding
# it performs is the rounding fixed$ was asked for and declined to do.
#
#   - fixed$ honoured the request  ->  its answer is returned unchanged, so
#     every value that already printed correctly still prints identically.
#   - fixed$ escalated             ->  the value is rounded to .decimals here
#     and re-formatted. Rounding 0.6 to 0 decimals is 1, not 0: the repair is
#     "round properly", not "call it zero", and a check that only looked at
#     tiny values would have missed that.
#   - the rounded value is zero    ->  a canonical zero of the right width is
#     built, "0.0000" at four decimals and "0" at none, because fixed$ answers
#     "0" at every width.
#   - undefined                    ->  passed straight through to fixed$, so
#     "--undefined--" is still what an undefined statistic prints. Praat also
#     renders every infinity as undefined, so the non-finite cases arrive here
#     already collapsed and need no branch of their own.
#
# THE ONE NUMBER THAT MUST NOT COME THROUGH HERE IS ALPHA, and this is the
# paragraph a future display sweep has to argue with before it "finishes the
# job" by routing the last holdout in. @emlReportAlpha, in
# stats/eml-analysis.praat, formats the significance CRITERION with a raw
# fixed$ (.value, 3) and then trims trailing zeros back to two places, so an
# ordinary alpha reads "0.05" and a stricter one reads "0.001". That looks
# like an escape from this procedure and it is not one: it is the exemption,
# and it is deliberate. Route it through @eml_fixed and @emlReportAlpha starts
# printing an alpha of .0001 as "0.000" -- the threshold the report says it
# marked significance against, rendered as zero, which is the one value no
# threshold can have. The escalation this procedure exists to suppress is the
# escalation @emlReportAlpha depends on.
#
# WHY THE EXEMPTION IS RIGHT. The rule this procedure enforces is a rule about
# STATISTICS -- a t, a skewness, a Cohen's
# d, a mean difference, each of them a measurement of the data whose seventeen
# trailing digits are arithmetic noise the reader is better off not seeing.
# Alpha is not a measurement of anything. It is a criterion the reader chose
# and the report is quoting back, and quoting a criterion at less precision
# than it was set with is not tidying, it is misreporting -- a reader who set
# .0001 and reads "0.000" has been told their own threshold is impossible. So
# the two are not the same kind of number and they do not get the same rule:
# a statistic is rounded to a house width, a criterion is shown exactly.
# validate/v70_p_precision.R drives @emlReportAlpha at .05, .01, .001 and
# .0001 and asserts all four, so a sweep that routes it here goes red rather
# than quiet.
#
# THE MULTIPLICATION IS SAFE FOR EVERY VALUE THAT REACHES IT. .value * 10^.d
# could overflow for a large .value, but the escalation branch is unreachable
# for one: fixed$ escalates only when |.value| < 10 raised to (1 - .decimals),
# so anything routed through the rounding is already small.
#
# Arguments:
#   .value, .decimals - as fixed$
# Outputs:
#   .result$ - the value at exactly .decimals decimals, or "--undefined--"

# THREE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES, IN SCIENTIFIC NOTATION, FOR A NUMBER THAT MAY BE
# 1e-300. This exists for exactly one caller -- @emlFormatP's .exact$ tail --
# and neither fixed$ nor string$ can do its job.
#
# WHY THE TAIL EXISTS AT ALL. Flooring at .001 flattens 5.8e-07, 2.1e-13 and
# 3.0e-04 into one string nine orders of magnitude apart; the tail
# is what un-flattens them, and v65_display_standard.R asserts it is there
# beside every floored label. What the tail owes the reader is the ORDER OF
# MAGNITUDE -- 5.8e-07 and 2.1e-13 must not read alike -- and three
# significant figures carry all of that and nothing else.
#
# WHY NOT string$. string$ is Praat's ROUND-TRIP renderer: it emits however
# many digits it takes to reconstruct the double exactly, which for a p just
# under the floor is seventeen. A repeated-measures line meaning "about 3e-29"
# comes out as
#
#     F(2, 38) = 583.1232, p < .001  (3.0359635874099574e-29)
#
# -- seventeen significant digits nobody can read, in the Info window, where
# no raw double belongs.
#
# WHY NOT fixed$, AND WHY THIS IS NOT ONE MORE @eml_fixed CALL. @eml_fixed
# gives a fixed number of DECIMALS, and the answer to "3e-29 at four decimals"
# is 0.0000 -- the tail collapsed to zero, which is worse than seventeen
# digits, because it is the same flattening wearing a tidier face. A
# naive fixed$ does not merely fail on the small end of the range, it fails on
# every value the tail exists for. Significant figures and decimal places are
# different quantities and this is the range where the difference is the
# entire point.
#
# HOW IT IS DONE, PRAAT HAVING NO printf. The exponent is floor (log10 |v|)
# and the mantissa is |v| scaled by that power of ten, rounded to two decimals
# -- one digit before the point and two after is three significant figures --
# and re-emitted through @eml_fixed so the mantissa is exactly two decimals
# wide even when it rounds to a whole number, "3.00e-29" rather than "3e-29".
# Three things in that are load-bearing and each of them is a case a shorter
# version gets wrong:
#
# THE SCALING IS DONE IN TWO STEPS BELOW 1e-150. Dividing by 10^.e is exact
# and cheap while 10^.e is a normal double, and for .e below about -300 it is
# not one: the divisor goes subnormal, loses bits, and the mantissa comes back
# wrong in its second digit -- silently, on precisely the smallest p values,
# which are the ones with the least chance of anyone checking. Multiplying by
# 10^150 first and by 10^(-.e-150) second keeps both factors normal for every
# exponent a double can hold.
#
# THE MANTISSA IS RE-NORMALISED AFTER ROUNDING, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Rounding
# 9.999 to two decimals is 10.00, which is four significant figures and a
# mantissa out of range, so it carries into the exponent and becomes 1.00e+1
# larger. And log10 is not exact: a p of 1e-5 can return -4.999999999999999 or
# -5.000000000000001 depending on the bits, which floors to -5 or to -6 and
# leaves the mantissa at 1 or at 10. Both directions are corrected here, so
# the renderer does not have a one-in-a-thousand answer that reads "10.0e-06".
#
# THE EXPONENT IS PADDED TO TWO DIGITS, "3.00e-04" and not "3.00e-4", because
# that is the shape Praat's own string$ emits ("9.99e-05") and a tail that
# matches the surrounding conventions is a tail nobody rewrites.
#
# THE UPPER FLOOR IS THE SAME PROBLEM MIRRORED, and it is why the caller does
# not simply hand p to this procedure in both branches. @emlFormatP also
# floors at the top -- "p > .999" for p >= 0.9995 -- and three significant
# figures OF p up there is 1.00 for every value in the range, which flattens
# 0.9996 and 0.99999999 into one string -- the same flattening on the other
# side.
# What carries the information near one is the DISTANCE from one, so the
# caller passes 1 - p and labels it. The subtraction is exact in binary for
# any p in [0.5, 2], so the printed tail is not an approximation of a
# difference; it is the difference.
#
# IT FORMATS AND ONLY FORMATS. Nothing is written back, no computed p is
# touched, and the CSV writers do not call it -- full precision stays in the
# export, which is the artefact a reader is meant to compute from.

# TextEncoding.outputEncoding is "try ASCII, then UTF-16": a report whose only
# non-ASCII is its own box rule lands as UTF-16BE with a BOM, and so does a CSV
# whose only non-ASCII is one Greek letter in one cell. R's read.csv, pandas,
# Excel and this repo's own validate/ scripts all then read the file as binary,
# so a run that computed everything correctly produces results nobody
# downstream can open.
#
# THE INFO WINDOW IS NOT FOLDED. On screen the box rules and "χ²" are the

# to be plain. That is why the fold lives at the two writers and not in the

# ============================================================================
# CSV EXPORT — tidy long format
# ============================================================================
# LONG, NOT WIDE. A fixed wide schema for the output of every test in the
# plugin -- one header of the shape
#
#   table,data_col,group_col,group1,group2,test,statistic,df,p,effect_size,
#   effect_type,effect_label,n1,n2,mean1,sd1,median1,mean2,sd2,median2
#
# -- fails structurally in three ways, and widening it fixes none of them:
#
#   1. NO WAY TO SAY "NOT APPLICABLE". Every argument goes through fixed$ or
#      string$, so a caller with nothing to report has to pass a number, and
#      what it passes is 0. A one-way omnibus row then ends in eight zeros
#      meaning "not applicable", indistinguishable from eight measurements
#      of zero, and a no-Tukey fallback writes p = 0.000000, which reads as
#      the most significant result in the file.
#
#   2. SLOTS REUSED FOR UNRELATED QUANTITIES. There is nowhere for a
#      regression's slope but mean1, its SE but sd1, its intercept but
#      median1, and R but sd2; nowhere for correlation's Y variable but
#      group_col; nowhere for a paired test's two column names but the four
#      level slots. The header then says one thing and the file contains
#      another.
#
#   3. NOTHING CAN BE ADDED. One df column cannot hold a numerator and a
#      denominator, so F(1,28) exports as df=1.00 and cannot be
#      reconstructed; there is nowhere to put SS, MS, a confidence interval
#      or a per-cell n.
#
# The long format has none of these problems. Every value is named where it is
# written, so no slot can be reused; a value you do not have is a row you do
# not write, so no sentinel is needed and none exists; and a new quantity is
# a new field name, not a schema change.
#
#   table,analysis,term,term_type,field,value
#
#   table     -- the source Table's name
#   analysis  -- "One-way ANOVA", "Tukey HSD", "Pearson correlation", ...
#   term      -- what the row is about: a contrast ("Soprano vs Alto"), a
#                factor ("voice_type"), a coefficient ("practice_hrs_wk"), a
#                group ("Alto"), or "" for an omnibus/overall result
#   term_type -- WHICH KIND of thing `term` names. See below.
#   field     -- "F", "df1", "df2", "p", "eta_squared", "estimate", "se",
#                "ci_lower", "n", "mean", "sd", "median", ...
#   value     -- the number, or a string for fields like "method"
#
# WHY term_type IS A COLUMN AND NOT JUST ANOTHER FIELD ROW.
# The first version of this format did not have it, and pivoting the result
# produced a ragged table: a contrast ("Soprano vs Mezzo") and a group
# ("Soprano") both live in `term`, so pivot_wider interleaved q and p_adjusted
# rows with n and mean rows and filled the gaps with NA. Nothing was wrong —
# every row was correct and self-labelled — but the reader had to know to
# filter first, and "you have to know" is a smaller version of the disease
# this format was written to cure. As a field row it would not have helped:
# the whole problem is separating rows BEFORE the pivot, which needs a column.
#
#   omnibus     the analysis as a whole; `term` is ""
#   contrast    a comparison between two levels
#   group       one level's descriptives
#   factor      a term in an ANOVA table (main effect, interaction)
#   coefficient a regression coefficient
#   error       the error line of an ANOVA table
#   total       the total line of an ANOVA table
#   variable    a single measured column (normality, correlation)
#
# So the useful reads are one filter and one pivot:
#   d <- read.csv("x.csv")
#   subset(d, term_type == "contrast") |>
#       tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = field, values_from = value)
#   subset(d, term_type == "group") |>
#       tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = field, values_from = value)
#
# Numbers are written with string$, which is Praat's shortest round-trip
# form: 0.002246 stays 0.002246 and 1.06e-14 stays 1.06e-14 rather than
# becoming 0.00000000000001. That also keeps the report's p-value flooring
# out of the export, without a separate decision about decimal places.

# and a UTF-16 CSV is not a CSV to read.csv, to pandas, to Excel or to
# validate/. So every cell has to be folded before it is written.
#
# And the fold can PRODUCE a CSV metacharacter: a curly quote folds to a
# straight one. Folded after the test, "he said "yes"" -- a cell with no comma
# and no straight quote, so left unquoted -- lands as a bare quote inside an
# unquoted field. Measured: R's read.csv reads that cell back as

# THE MIGRATION FORK, IN ONE PLACE. A path that has been converted to the

# @emlResultBegin sets emlResult_declared; a path that has not still fills the
# single-file buffer. The fork is on the DECLARATION, not on a per-analysis
# list, so a path converts by declaring and nothing here has to be edited for
# each one.
#
# WHY IT IS A PROCEDURE. Inline inside one export path, the fork cannot be
# reached by the other, and the same analysis then produces three
# broom-shaped files from one button and one legacy long-format file from the
# other. v20/v21 enumerate the stats-menu orchestrators, so a second exporter
# is not something they can see; one implementation both buttons write
# through is.
#
# WRITING ONLY -- no dialogs. The two callers report differently (the wrapper
# lists every file it wrote; the graphs form already has its own Export
# Complete / Export Failed pair), and a shared procedure that opened a dialog
# could not be called from inside another one.
#
# BOTH ARMS ARE NON-DESTRUCTIVE, which needs @emlGenerateUniquePath to be
# reachable from here: it lives in eml-core-utilities.praat and not in
# graphs/eml-graphs-form.praat, which is
# included AFTER this file, so it was unreachable from here and the three-file
# export would silently overwrite a previous one. Moving that procedure to
# stats/eml-core-utilities.praat -- the first include in both barrels -- is
# what closed it. The BASE is uniqued once, against the tidy frame, and every
# frame in the set then shares the walked base, so a set never half-overwrites
# an older set. The legacy arm keeps the uniquing it always had, inside
# @emlReportToFile.
#
# Arguments:
#   .folder$ — destination folder, no trailing separator
#   .base$   — file name stem, no extension

# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A PROCEDURE rather than as three lines at each call site.
# The question "has an analysis produced something exportable" has exactly two

# unconverted analysis fills the legacy buffer (emlCSV_n), a converted one
# declares into the broom collectors (emlResult_declared). Anyone asking the
# question has to know both, and to know that Praat does NOT short-circuit
# `and`, so the read has to be nested or it aborts on the very session the
# guard was written for.
#
# That knowledge belongs to this file and nowhere else. v46 pins exactly that:
# only eml-output.praat may branch on the migration flag, because a second
# reader is a second thing to update on the day the migration finishes -- and
# the way this class of defect actually arrives is that the second reader is
# updated late, or not at all, and disagrees silently. The recorder's replay
# writer needs the answer (it writes the same set of files headlessly, with no
# panel), so it asks rather than re-deriving.

# CLASSIFY THE LABEL COLUMN A COERCION MANUFACTURES. It does not assume the
# column holds anything, and it does not invent anything to put in it.
#
# THE RULE IS THAT A PROBE CLASSIFIES COLUMN TYPES AND NEVER ASSUMES NUMERIC.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. `To Table: "row"` writes the source object's ROW LABELS into
# a column called "row". A Matrix has none, and a TableOfReal may have none or
# may have some. Praat stores a missing label as an UNDEFINED cell, and
# `Get value:` renders an undefined cell as the one-character string "?" --
# measured on 6.6.30. That string is not "" and it is not "--undefined--",
# which are the two forms @eml_strictNumericColumn's scan recognises, so an
# unclassified column passes the scan as readable and the numericiser behind
# it raises:
#
#     Table "eml_numericProbe": the cell in row 1 of column "row" is
#     undefined. ... cannot get all numbers in column 1.
#
# -- a native abort with an internal temp table's name in it, fired from
# @emlGuessColumnRoles BEFORE the wrapper's dialog opens, on every Matrix and
# on every TableOfReal whose row labels are missing or partial.
#
# "?" ROUND-TRIPS BACK TO UNDEFINED. `Set string value: r, c$, "?"` stores an
# undefined cell again, so writing the literal back does not help: the
# partial-label case then fails a second way, because @eml_strictOneCell
# copies the literal into a one-cell probe table named "v" and the same raise
# returns with "v" in the message instead of "row". The cell has to be set to
# a string Praat will actually keep.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Every unlabelled cell
# becomes the EMPTY STRING -- a form every EML classifier already handles, and
# the one @eml_strictNumericColumn was written to treat as unreadable. The
# result is a classification (.strict = 0, .unreadable = 1) instead of an
# abort.
#
# It does NOT fill in default row labels, and it does not delete the column.
# Default labels are a naming decision that belongs with the conversion side

# this plugin classifies as a measurement and every column picker then offers
# as one, and blank is a column with a name and no content that a user has to
# guess the meaning of. "r1" cannot be mistaken for data in any locale, so the

# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A MATRIX HAS NO COLUMN NAMES EITHER, and `To Table: "row"` writes the literal
# "?" as the header of every one of them. So a three-column Matrix arrived at
# Compare groups, Correlate and Regression with a column menu reading
#
#     row, ?, ?, ?
#
# -- three identically named columns. That is the duplicate-label hazard
# arriving by the coercion route rather than by the editor's: every
# name-addressed read in this plugin is
# `Get value: row, name$`, Praat returns the FIRST column of that name, and the
# second and third are unreachable. Picking "?" number 2 out of the menu does
# not fail -- it silently analyses column 2's data under column 3's heading,
# and the user has no way to see it. Nothing in an output names a column index.
#
# @emlCleanConvertedTable performs the same rename in the graphs layer, by
# the same rule.
#
# THE NUMBER IN THE NAME IS THE SOURCE COLUMN'S NUMBER, NOT THE TABLE'S.
# `To Table: "row"` has already put the manufactured label column in position
# 1 by the time this runs, so numbering by TABLE POSITION gives
#
#     source Matrix column 1  ->  table position 2  ->  named "Column_2"
#     source Matrix column 2  ->  table position 3  ->  named "Column_3"
#
# and nothing is called "Column_1" at all. A user who asks for "column 2 of my
# matrix" then reads the menu, picks Column_2, and is given column 1's data --
# a wrong-column read that survives the duplicate-name repair, because an
# invented name that does not say which column of the user's object it is has
# no failure symptom: every value is a real value, from a real column, of the
# right length, under a heading that is off by one.
#
# .insertedCols is HOW MANY COLUMNS THE COERCION PUT IN FRONT of the source's
# first column, and it is a parameter rather than a hard-coded 1 because the
# offset is a property of the CALLER's conversion, not of this procedure. Both
# call sites in @emlWrapperInit pass 1, for the one `row` column that
# `To Table: "row"` manufactures -- including the arm where the collision
# guard has renamed it to "OriginalRowLabel", which moves its NAME and not its
# position. A caller with no manufactured column passes 0 and gets the
# identity mapping back.
#
# COMPOSES WITH A PARTIALLY LABELLED SOURCE. The loop tests each header
# separately, so a TableOfReal labelled "", "b", "" produces Column_1, b,
# Column_3: the labels the user supplied are kept, and the gaps are numbered
# with the source's own numbering rather than with a count of the gaps. A
# count of the gaps would have named that third column "Column_2", which is
# the same off-by-one wearing different clothes.
#
# THE LOOP STARTS AFTER THE INSERTED BLOCK, and that is a guard rather than an
# optimisation. Positions inside the block have no source column to be numbered
# after -- `.c - .insertedCols` is 0 or less there -- so scanning them could
# only ever write a name that is either meaningless ("Column_0") or a duplicate
# of the real column 1's name, and a duplicate is the exact hazard this
# procedure exists to remove. The block is the caller's own manufactured
# column, which the caller has already named: `To Table: "row"` names it "row"
# and the collision guard renames it "OriginalRowLabel". Neither is ever "?",
# measured on 6.6.30 -- so this skips nothing. If one ever did arrive
# unnamed, validate/v63's "no duplicate or unnamed column" assertion says so,
# which is a red line rather than an invented name nobody can interpret.

# ONE SOURCE OBJECT, ONE CONVERTED TABLE, however many times a door is pressed.
#
# Every press of a stats wrapper on the same Matrix or TableOfReal
# manufactures a fresh Table named "eml_converted_<source>". Without this,
# five presses leave five objects with the same name in the Objects window,
# and that is not only clutter: `selectObject: "Table eml_converted_mx"` then
# answers with one of the five and the user has no way to say which. It is
# the duplicate-name hazard one level up -- names that address objects rather
# than columns -- and it arrives without any error at all.
#
# CLEANED UP RATHER THAN REUSED, and the reason is staleness. Reusing the
# existing Table would be cheaper and would be wrong the moment the user edits
# the source object between presses: the second press would analyse the first
# press's data under the second press's dialog, silently, which is the same
# class of defect as the column mis-addressing above. Dropping and re-coercing
# always describes the object as it is now.
#
# AT THE TOP OF THE NEXT PRESS, WHICH IS THE PLACEMENT THAT SURVIVES A CRASH.
# This is the same argument that puts the rename at creation, on the line
# after the conversion. A cleanup handler at the BOTTOM of
# @emlWrapperInit would be skipped by exactly the native error the rename
# exists to survive, and would then leak on precisely the runs that matter. A
# cleanup at the TOP runs before anything can fail, and it collects the stray
# a crashed previous run left behind as well as the tidy one -- so the two
# placements are complementary rather than alternatives. The steady state is
# at most one stray, and only between a crash and the next press.
#
# THE LOOP, not a single removal, because an Objects window can hold any
# number of them; one press collects the lot. The bound is a safety rail, not
# a limit anyone should reach.

# plugin's, and it is the answer on exactly one of the three platforms this
# plugin ships to. The set below is the union of what any supported platform
# refuses, because a base name is a thing users carry between machines:
#
#     /   POSIX and macOS path separator; refused here, measured
#     \   Windows path separator
#     :   Windows reserved; the classic Mac OS separator, which Finder still
#         renders as "/" -- so a name with ":" reads back as a different name
#     * ? < > |   refused by every Windows filesystem
#     "   refused by Windows AND unsafe here for a second reason: the panel
#         emits `@emlSavePanel: 0, "<stem>", outputFolder$` into a RECORDED
#         script, and a quote inside the stem closes that string early. A
#         recorded workflow would replay into a parse error.
#
# Praat's `word:` field refuses a SPACE itself -- measured: it raises
# "should be a single ink-word and cannot contain a space", keeps the dialog
# up and lets the user correct it -- so spaces need no handling here.
#
# APPENDIX E DOES NOT APPLY. %, #, ^ and _ are Praat's style toggles in
# PICTURE-window text. `comment:` in a pause form is a GTK label and renders
# all four literally -- driven and screenshotted on 6.6.30 -- and the
# plugin's own suffixes (_tidy.csv, _glance.csv) are made of "_", so
# escaping them here would corrupt every file name the panel writes.
#
# SANITISE SILENTLY, THEN DISCLOSE -- and the choice is made against this
# panel's existing behaviour rather than in the abstract. The panel already
# repairs quietly and shows the result: it CREATES a folder the user typed
# but does not have, it SUBSTITUTES "eml_results_<stamp>" for an empty name,
# and it WALKS the stem to _1 when the name is taken. None of the three asks
# first, and all three are visible afterwards because the receipt lists the
# full absolute path of every file written. A refusal, by contrast, would
# have to re-open the dialog, and re-opening it is where the one-stamp rule
# is easiest to break -- a second @emlFileStamp would put two seconds on one
# analysis. It would also answer a user who has just finished an analysis
# with a "no" at the last step, which is the shape of failure this whole fix
# exists to remove. The receipt says what the name became when it changed, so
# nothing is hidden.
#
# THE STAMP IS UNTOUCHED. Sanitising happens ONCE, on the stem, before the
# collision walk and before any write, so every file of one press still
# carries one base name and one stamp -- the author's condition of 14 Aug
# 2026.

#
# WHAT IT COST TO LEARN. Point the panel at a folder that exists and cannot
# be written -- a read-only network share, a locked-down departmental drive,
# a mount that went read-only under you -- and 6.6.30 answers, mid-save:
#
#     Error: Cannot create file "<folder>/<stem>_tidy.csv".
#     Not-so-useful hint: unexpected error 30.
#
# Praat's own words. The script stops inside @emlSavePanel exactly as the
# slash case does, and takes the receipt, the panel's return, and the
# caller's post-analysis loop with it. Reproduced on a read-only tmpfs.
# A folder that does not exist under an unwritable parent
# fails one line EARLIER, on the panel's own `createFolder:` -- "Cannot create
# folder" -- so the guard has to cover the creation too, not just the write.
#
# WHY A PROBE FILE AND NOT A PREDICATE. Praat has no try/catch, and
# folderExists() answers about READING. The only honest question is whether a
# write lands, so one is performed and then removed. `nocheck` is what makes
# that safe: measured on 6.6.30, `nocheck writeFile:` on an unwritable path
# leaves the script running, and fileReadable() afterwards is the answer.

# DID THE FILE ARRIVE? Asked of the disk, not of the command.
#
# Praat's Save commands answer nothing on success and, under `nocheck`, answer
# nothing on failure either. A save that quietly did nothing is therefore
# indistinguishable from a save that worked, unless something looks. This is
# the looking: the file must be READABLE, it must contain at least one line,
# and that line must carry the format's own marker.
#
#     PNG   "PNG"     the signature's first printable bytes
#     EPS   "%!PS"    PostScript
#     PDF   "%PDF"    PDF
#
# WHY THE MARKER IS MATCHED INSIDE THE LINE RATHER THAN ANCHORED AT ITS START.
# A PNG begins with byte 0x89 before the letters PNG, and Praat's text reader
# drops it -- measured on 6.6.30, where the first line reads back as "PNG".
# Anchoring with startsWith would then depend on how a given build handles one
# invalid UTF-8 byte, and the failure would be a figure reported as missing
# when it is on disk. `index` is stable across that. The byte-exact signature
# is checked on the R side, by validate/v86, which can read bytes.
#
# WHY `Read Strings from raw text file:` AND NOT readFile$. readFile$ is a
# function, so no prefix can be put in front of it, and on any file containing
# a null byte -- every PNG, and most PDFs -- it raises Praat's "Ignored N null
# bytes" WARNING, which in the GUI is a dialog the user has to dismiss in the
# middle of their save. `nowarn` is a command prefix and this is a command, so
# the warning is suppressed at source. Reading a 600-dpi PNG this way was
# measured at under a millisecond.
#
# THE OBJECT LIST IS PUT BACK EXACTLY AS IT WAS. The read makes a Strings
# object, which is removed again, and the caller's selection is restored --
# including the case where nothing was selected, which `selectObject:` on an
# empty vector restores correctly. The new object is identified by COUNTING
# rather than by `selected ("Strings")`: if the read had failed while the user
# happened to have a Strings of their own selected, that name would have found
# THEIR object and this procedure would have removed it.

#
# A COMMAND THAT DOES NOT EXIST ABORTS THE SCRIPT: "Command ... not available
# for current selection", and every line after it, including the receipt,
# never runs. Measured on 6.6.30. So the vector attempts are made under
# `nocheck`, which lets the script survive an absent command -- also measured:
# the line after it ran -- and then the DISK is asked whether a file arrived.
# A host that provides the format leaves a file; a host that does not leaves
# nothing, and one piece of code reads both answers.
#
# THE PNG IS CHECKED THE SAME WAY, AND THE CHECK IS NOT REDUNDANT ANYWHERE.
# The PNG save is not under `nocheck` -- that command exists everywhere and a
# genuine write error should still be Praat's to report -- but a save that
# silently does nothing raises nothing either, and an unverified save is a
# promise nobody checked. A full disk, a folder that cannot be written to, a
# path the user has no permission for: none of those is a platform question
# and every one of them ends with a missing file. A file that did not land is
# not counted, not listed on the receipt, and is named to the user.

#
# A REDIRECT, NOT AN ERROR. The user asked for a file, no file exists, and the

# press DID write, and where to go next. A dialog that only said "PDF failed"
# would read as a lost save.
#
# NO FORMAT IS THE CONSOLATION PRIZE, and that is the shape of the whole
# message. The PNG is written on every press, so it is the name most likely to
# be in the "did write" list -- but it is a raster, and a user who ticked a
# vector box because a journal asked them for vector is not served by being
# told their PNG is safe. EPS is vector, and Praat writes EPS wherever Praat
# runs. So the closing paragraph turns on EPS and not on PNG:
#
#   EPS is in the landed list    the user HAS a vector figure, and is told so
#                                plainly rather than left to infer it
#   EPS is in the missing list   the vector copy is what went, and the folder
#                                rather than the format is what to look at
#   EPS is in neither list       it was never ticked, so the message asks for
#                                it -- and this is the redirect that matters,
#                                because it is the case of a user who ticked
#                                PDF alone on a host that has no PDF
#
# WHAT LANDED IS READ OFF THE DISK. .landed$ and .fileList$ are what
# @eml_saveFigureFormats FOUND after writing, never what the panel asked for,
# so nothing here can promise a file that is not on the disk.
#
# NO PLATFORM IS NAMED. Which formats a given Praat provides is a property of

# @emlSavePanel: .offerFigure, .stem$, .folder$
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ONE SAVE, ONE FOLDER, ONE NAME. Everything an analysis produces — the
# figure, the numbers, the report — written in a single action under a shared
# stem, so a study's outputs arrive as a set instead of three files the user
# has to keep together by hand.
#
# THE TITLE IS "Save" FOR ONE PANEL AND "Save page" FOR SEVERAL, and a page
# gets one extra line giving the extent union's size in inches. That is the
# whole of what page composition adds here: the figure written is the union,
# which is what this panel has always written. See WHAT IS ON THE PAGE in the
# body for why there is no "finish page" action to go with it.
#
# WHY A PANEL AND NOT THREE BUTTONS. The saves belong on the dialog rather
# than hidden in a menu, and three separate buttons would satisfy that. A
# panel does better for a reason that is about the files rather than the
# widgets: separate buttons each remember a DIFFERENT folder
# (config_lastPNGFolder$, config_lastCSVFolder$, the record-save default) and
# each derive their own name, so one analysis scatters its outputs across
# three places under three naming conventions. A single folder and stem is
# only expressible if the three are chosen together.
#
# THE REPORT IS SAVABLE FROM HERE. The plugin tells users their results are in
# the Info window -- "The results are in the Info window; the CSV buffer for
# this test is empty" -- so there has to be a way to keep it.
# @emlSaveInfoToFile is what writes it.
#
# THE FIGURE BRANCH IS REACHED WHEN THERE IS A FIGURE, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME
# THING AS WHEN THE CALLER SAYS SO. .offerFigure = 1 comes from the graphs
# form, where a figure has just been drawn; the stats wrappers pass 0 because
# at the END of an analysis nothing has been drawn yet. That 0 was then read
# as "and nothing ever will be", which is false the moment a wrapper's Draw
# button hands off to the graphs workflow and comes BACK to its own
# Done | Save | Draw | New loop: the next press of Save was a 0 standing over
# a violin plot, and the figure could only be kept by having saved it before
# pressing Done. So the argument is a FLOOR and not the whole answer -- the
# panel also asks the page whether anything is on it. See IS THERE A FIGURE?
# in the body.
#
# IT IS STILL SAFE FOR THIS STATS-LAYER PROCEDURE TO CALL
# @emlAssertFullViewport. The call sits inside the branch, Praat resolves a
# procedure name only when the call actually executes, and the second way
# into that branch is itself gated on `variableExists ("emlDrawnMinX")` -- a
# global the graphs layer assigns at file scope. A stats-only script --
# eml-lib-stats.praat without the graphs barrel -- has no such variable, so it
# cannot enter the branch and can still use this panel.
#
# AND THE ARGUMENT IS NOT THE ONLY GATE. The paragraph above is a claim about
# thirteen call sites, and no reader can check it -- one wrapper passing 1
# would raise "Procedure emlAssertFullViewport not found" at the Save press,
# which is the class of break harness/check_includes.py exists for and the one
# it cannot see, because it cannot read arguments. So the two calls also sit
# behind `if variableExists ("emlDrawnMinX")`, which is true exactly when the
# layer that defines the procedure is loaded -- and which is now also the gate
# on the detected way into the branch, so both ways in carry the same proof
# and a static reader can confirm each of them.
#
# Arguments:
#   .offerFigure  1 when the caller has just drawn a figure; 0 to leave the
#                 question to the panel, which asks the page itself
#   .stem$        default file name, no extension
#   .folder$      default folder
# Outputs:
#   .cancelled    1 if the user backed out
#   .nWritten     how many files were written
#   .fileList$    newline-separated absolute paths
#   .folder$      the folder actually used (for the caller to remember)

# Eta-squared, PARTIAL eta-squared and epsilon-squared share the 0.01 / 0.06 /

# DENOMINATOR, and the denominator is what a "% of variance" sentence is
# about, so each gets its own procedure and its own sentence.
#
#   eta-squared          SS_effect / SS_total
#                        The denominator is the whole variance. A share of the
#                        whole is what this is, and the sentence may say so.
#
#   partial eta-squared  SS_effect / (SS_effect + SS_error)
#                        Every OTHER effect is out of the denominator, so each
#                        effect in a factorial table is a share of a different
#                        quantity. On a two-way table the three values are
#                        free to sum past 100% -- 44 + 71 + 26 = 141 is an
#                        ordinary result, not a miscomputation -- because they
#                        were never shares of one total. The sentence has to
#                        carry that, on every line, or the arithmetic reads as
#                        an error.
#
#   epsilon-squared      H / (n - 1)
#                        H is computed from RANKS, so the variance this is a

# ============================================================================
# ERROR PRESENTATION
# ============================================================================
# An analysis that cannot run is not a crash and must not be presented as
# one. Two shapes to avoid:
#
#   1. A raw error string in a bare @pauseScript, whose only button is
#      Continue, returns the user to the entry form for a test the error has
#      just told them is the wrong test — and that form's only other button
#      is Quit.
#
#   2. An analysis error that calls @exitScript from inside the Stats Wizard
#      tears down the whole wizard, including every answer the user gave on
#      the way in.
#
# Each path is handled in the way that suits it, and none of this restructures
# how a test is chosen from the menu:
#
#   * Wizard path — the wizard owns a full goto/label back-chain, so an
#     error returns the user into that chain rather than ending the script.
#   * Menu path — the menu selection IS the navigation, and a running script
#     cannot reopen a Praat menu. So the dialog cannot offer to take the
#     user to another tool; what it can do is say plainly that a different
#     tool is needed, name it, and give the menu path to reach it.
# ============================================================================


# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# @emlWrapText: .s$, .width
#
# Greedy word wrap that keeps a "label = value" unit whole. Written for
# @emlErrorDialog: Praat's `comment:` field in a pause dialog does not wrap,
# and orchestrator error strings run well past any sensible dialog width, so
# they are broken up here. (`comment:` is a Praat dialog command, not an EML
# procedure — it takes no "@".)
#
# IT IS NOT ONLY THE DIALOG'S. @emlReportNote wraps to the report's 68-column
# body through this, and @emlDrawAnnotationBlock
# (graphs/eml-annotation-procedures.praat) wraps annotation lines through it
# to a character budget converted from the plotting frame. So .width is a
# CHARACTER count and every caller owns the conversion from whatever units it
# actually cares about; do not add a unit assumption here.
#
# "LABEL = VALUE" IS ONE UNIT, AND THE ONE SPECIAL CASE IN HERE.
# Everything this procedure wraps is read one line at a time — a corner
# caption on a figure, a comment row in a pause dialog, an indented note in
# the report — and a break at either space around an equals sign hands the
# reader a label whose number is on the next line, or an "=" sitting alone at
# a line end. "Cohen's d = 0.83" is a single fact and it travels as one.
#
# So the space BEFORE an "=" and the space AFTER it are not break candidates:
# the line breaks at the last space that is not part of such a unit. Every
# other property callers depend on holds unchanged by the rule — breaks land
# on spaces, no line exceeds .width, and the segments' word count still sums
# to the input's, which is what @emlDrawAnnotationBlock needs to carry
# Picture markup across a break word for word.
#
# WHEN THE UNIT IS ITSELF WIDER THAN THE LINE nothing can keep it whole, so
# the search falls back to the last space of any kind, and then to a hard
# break. Keeping a unit together is a preference; the width limit outranks it.
#
# WHAT THE RULE COSTS, and it was driven rather than reasoned about, because
# holding a unit together can only push the longest line out and a longer
# longest line is what sends @emlDrawAnnotationBlock's fit loop round again.
# Measured 20 Aug 2026 by harness/wraptext/ over 39 annotation strings taken
# from the omnibus, correlation, regression and disclosure call sites, at
# every width from 16 to 72 (2223 wraps), and over 1274 annotation boxes —
# 182 blocks of one to six of those lines on seven figure sizes:
#
#   * The longest line grows in 21 wraps of 2223 (0.94%), by a median of 3
#     characters and at most 5, and never past .width. It SHRINKS in 442
#     (19.9%): deferring a unit to the next line usually pulls the widest
#     line in rather than out.
#   * @emlDrawAnnotationBlock takes one extra fit pass on 4 boxes of 1274
#     (0.31%, one in 319) and never more than one; it takes FEWER passes on
#     135 (10.6%). Drawn rows go up on 5.7% of boxes and down on 1.4%.
#   * Breaks touching an equals sign, over those same boxes: 1316 to none.
#
# The fallback is reachable and is measured too: 7 wraps of 2223 still break
# beside an "=", all of them at a .width of 21 characters or less, where a
# single unit is wider than the whole line and the limit outranks the
# preference. None of them reaches a figure — across all 1274 boxes the drawn
# rows carry no such break at all, because no box's budget comes out that
# narrow at any figure size the theme produces.

#   .mode$   — "wizard", "menu" or "entry". Chooses the guidance and the
#              button that is not Quit, because the three cases can offer
#              genuinely different things.
#
# Returns:
#   .back — 1 if the user chose to continue, 0 if they chose Quit. Always 0
#           in "entry" mode, which has nothing to go back to.
#
# Callers must honour .back = 0 by ending cleanly. The dialog itself never
# calls @exitScript; deciding to stop is the caller's job, because only the
# caller knows what needs tearing down.
#
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# "entry" MODE, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE OF THE OTHER TWO
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The refusals a wrapper makes BEFORE its dialog opens — the wrong selection,
# a table with too few columns, a table with no numeric column at all — must
# not be a raw `exitScript: "..."`, which Praat presents as its OWN error
# window with
#
#     Script exited. Script ... not completed.
#     Command ... not executed.
#
# underneath: interpreter stack in place of a refusal this plugin has a
# dialog for, and the one moment a new user is most likely to be wrong about
# what to select is the moment they get the least help.
#
# THEY CANNOT SIMPLY BE POINTED AT "menu" MODE. With an empty remedy that
# branch ends
#
#     "If a different test is needed, click Quit, then pick it from the
#      Objects window under New > EML Stats & Graphs >"
#
# which is right for a test that ran and could not fit the data, and wrong
# for a refusal about the SELECTION: no different test would help, because
# no test has been reached. It also offers Back — and there is nothing behind
# it. The mode exists so that the remedy-aware wording can be carried without
# touching the two branches that are correct for their own cases; rewording
# the shared empty-remedy branch would make it vaguer for the path it serves
# in order to serve a path it was never written for.
#
# It carries ONE button, because there is exactly one thing to do: read it,
# close it, fix the selection, run the command again. A running Praat script
# cannot change the object selection on the user's behalf, and offering a
# Back that can only re-refuse is worse than offering nothing.

# @emlReportDescriptiveAnalysis
#
# Lives here, in the output module, and not in eml-analysis.praat, because
# scripts/eml-describe-table.praat calls it and includes only
# eml-lib-stats.praat, which does not pull in the analysis module. (The other
# caller, @emlRunDescriptiveAnalysis in eml-analysis.praat, gets it either
# way.) Moving it here was forced by driving the wrapper: the parse check
# passed and the menu item raised "Procedure not found" the moment Run was
# clicked, because Praat resolves a procedure name when it is CALLED, not
# when the script is parsed. The error's line number is no use as a citation
# — it counts lines in the flattened script, after every `include` has been
# pasted in, so it names no line of any file on disk. harness/check_includes.py
# was written after this to find the class statically; the note above
# @emlRunLMMAnalysis's old home in eml-analysis.praat describes the same trap.
# A reporting procedure belongs with the reporting procedures anyway.
