# @emlCronbachAlpha
# ============================================================================
# Cronbach's alpha: internal consistency of a k-item scale.
#
# The input is one matrix, rows = respondents, columns = items, so a
# 20-respondent 5-item scale arrives as a 20 x 5 matrix. Rows holding
# an undefined cell are removed before computation (listwise deletion)
# and the removal is disclosed in .nExcluded.
#
# The confidence interval uses the Feldt (1965) F-distribution method
# with df1 = n - 1 and df2 = (n - 1)(k - 1), matching R's psych::alpha.
#
# ITS LEVEL IS AN ARGUMENT, not a constant, the same way @emlCI and the
# sibling @emlWilsonInterval take theirs. A caller working at alpha = .01
# gets a 99% interval by asking for one, and .confidence is echoed back
# beside the bounds so a report printing them can name the level it prints.
#
# Arguments:
#   .data##      - numeric matrix; rows = respondents, columns = items
#   .confidence  - confidence level as a proportion, e.g. 0.95
#
# Output:
#   .alpha            - Cronbach's alpha (covariance-based, sample
#                       variances with n - 1 denominator)
#   .ciLow            - lower bound of the Feldt interval
#   .ciHigh           - upper bound of the Feldt interval
#   .confidence       - the level the bounds were computed at, echoed
#   .k                - number of items (columns)
#   .n                - number of respondents used (complete rows)
#   .nExcluded        - rows removed by listwise deletion
#   .alphaIfDeleted#  - vector, length k: alpha of the scale with that
#                       item removed (undefined for every item when
#                       k = 2, because a one-item scale has no alpha)
#   .error$           - error message, or "" if valid
#
# Access pattern:
#   @emlCronbachAlpha: responses##, 0.95
#   a = emlCronbachAlpha.alpha
#   dropTwo = emlCronbachAlpha.alphaIfDeleted# [2]
#
# Notes:
#   - Items are assumed already scored in a consistent direction;
#     reverse-scoring is the caller's responsibility. An item scored
#     in the wrong direction lowers alpha — it is not detected here.
#   - Requires k >= 2 items and, after listwise deletion, n >= 3
#     respondents (the Feldt CI needs n - 1 >= 2).
#   - .confidence must lie strictly between 0 and 1; anything else is
#     refused in .error$ rather than handed to invFisherQ, whose tail
#     probability is undefined at 0 and at 1.
#   - Raw values are returned; callers format for display.

# @emlAlphaInfluence
# ============================================================================
# Respondent influence on Cronbach's alpha: leave-one-out jackknife over
# respondents. Where alpha-if-deleted asks whether one ITEM is spoiling
# the scale, this asks whether one RESPONDENT is: alpha is recomputed
# with each respondent removed, and each removal's effect on alpha is
# reported as a delta against the full complete-case alpha.
#
# The input is one matrix, rows = respondents, columns = items, the same
# shape @emlCronbachAlpha takes. Listwise deletion runs first, identical
# to the alpha kernel, and is disclosed in .nExcluded. All indexed
# outputs run over the SURVIVING rows, and .rowIndex# maps each entry
# back to its ORIGINAL row number in the input matrix, so a caller can
# still say "respondent 12" after rows above 12 were deleted.
#
# The kernel reports; it never judges. No thresholds, no outlier labels,
# no automatic exclusion — the numbers go out raw and the caller frames
# the evidence.

#   .n             - number of respondents used (complete rows)
#   .nExcluded     - rows removed by listwise deletion
#   .alphaWithout# - vector, length n: alpha with surviving respondent

#                    out total score has zero variance)

#   .rowIndex#     - vector, length n: ORIGINAL row number of surviving
#                    respondent j
