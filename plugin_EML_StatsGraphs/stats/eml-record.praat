# EML Stats & Graphs — Record workflow: buffer, phrases, renderer
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: accumulate every analysis and drawing step of a session and write
#          it out as a single annotated Praat script — one artifact that both
#          re-runs and reads like a lab notebook.
#
# Date: 9 August 2026
# Version: 1.0
#
# THIS FILE IS THE FOUNDATION ONLY. It is the buffer, the phrase table, the
# renderer and the flush. It deliberately does NOT touch a
# single wrapper: nothing here calls an orchestrator and no orchestrator yet
# calls anything here. That is the next increment, and it is separated on
# purpose, because everything in this file is testable headless and nothing
# about wiring a wrapper is.
#
# THERE IS NO ASCII SANITIZER HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
#
#   1. PRAAT WRITES UTF-16BE WHEN IT HAS TO. prefs5 carries
#          TextEncoding.outputEncoding: try ASCII, then UTF-16
#      so any report containing a box rule is written UTF-16 big-endian on
#      every installation that has ever saved preferences. (A sandbox with no
#      prefs5 applies a compiled-in default and writes UTF-8, which is a
#      machine no user has -- do not measure this without a prefs file.)
#
#   2. IT DOES NOT MATTER. Praat reads back what it writes: a UTF-16 script
#      is a perfectly good Praat script, verified by running one. Encoding
#      belongs to the layer that owns encoding, and a recorder that forced
#      ASCII would override a correct decision to protect against a
#      consequence that does not exist.
#
#   3. AND unicodeToBackslashTrigraphs$() WOULD NOT DO IT ANYWAY. It is not
#      exhaustive: it converts the characters Praat has trigraphs for and
#      passes the rest through untouched. Measured:
#          \o:  3 -> 1  converted      \em  3 -> 3  no such trigraph
#          \-m  3 -> 1  converted      \>=  3 -> 3  no such trigraph
#      A round-trip test on an unrecognised trigraph reports "lossless" while
#      converting nothing, so a round trip is not evidence unless it asks
#      whether conversion HAPPENED.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES COST, and it is not the emitted script. Byte-oriented tools
# downstream -- sed, grep, diff -- cannot read a UTF-16 capture with an ASCII
# pattern. harness/record/roundtrip.sh folds both captures to UTF-8 before
# comparing, so it tests content and leaves encoding to Praat.
#
# So there is no @emlLogAscii, no mapping table, no "?" fallback, and no
# pure-ASCII assertion in the validator. Forcing ASCII would be strictly
# worse than not: it would hand the user their own group labels back mangled,
# in a file whose whole purpose is to be publishable.
#
# WHAT DOES MATTER. Stream A carries Info-formatted strings
# into a file that is read as a script rather than as a report. The box rules
# and arrows in that text are decoration and belong in comments. The renderer
# below guarantees they land there — see @emlRecordRender — so that no reader
# later mistakes a rule character inside an executable line for something the
# recorder put there on purpose.

; PRESENT, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS RUNNING. Set at LOAD time, so any caller
; can tell "the recorder is loaded" from "the recorder has been initialised".
;
; variableExists ("emlRecordActive") CANNOT MEAN BOTH. It is true only while
; a recording lives inside one script scope, and a menu command runs in a
; FRESH scope: emlRecordActive does not exist yet even though a recording is
; in progress, so a draw-layer guard on that name is false and every figure
; drawn from the menu goes unrecorded. (A hook that calls @emlRecordInit
; before testing anything escapes it, which is why the difference has to be
; driven through runScript: rather than reasoned about part by part.)
;
; A caller with no recorder loaded -- a PraatGen companion file, a direct call
; into the draw library -- has no such variable, and the guarded call is never
; executed, which is what keeps the draw layer free of the recorder.

    ;
    ; A RUN is one pass through a GUI form and the save that belongs to it --
    ; one press of Run in a wrapper, one press of Draw in the graphs form,
    ; together with whatever that press recorded. It is the unit the editable
    ; block names its variables by: run 2's grouping column is groupCol2$,
    ; whether or not run 1 had a grouping column and whether or not the two

    ; command that opens a form and is cancelled records nothing and so
    ; consumes no number, which is what keeps the block's run numbers and the
    ; user's presses the same count.
    ;
    ; SCRIPT SCOPE IS ONE HALF OF THE BOUNDARY AND NOT THE WHOLE OF IT. A new
    ; menu command starts a fresh scope, so this variable is absent there and
    ; the next step opens a new run with no help from anybody. A wrapper's
    ; `New` button and the graphs form's `Redraw` stay inside ONE scope and
    ; are new runs even so; those call @emlRecordNewRun, which is the other

    ; the Pitch is removed -- so the pairing never crosses a script boundary.

    ; RE-ATTACH TO A RECORDING LEFT BY AN EARLIER MENU INVOCATION.
    ;
    ; This is what makes a recording span more than one menu command, and
    ; it works because of a fact about Praat rather than a trick: a script
    ; run from a menu ends and takes ALL its variables with it, but the
    ; OBJECTS it created stay in the Objects window, which belongs to the
    ; running Praat instance. emlRecordActive and emlRecordBufferId are
    ; gone by the time the next analysis starts. The buffer Table is not.
    ;
    ; So the buffer's EXISTENCE is the state. There is no flag file and no
    ; config key, which means there is nothing that can disagree with the
    ; data -- the switch and the buffer are the same object. It is also why
    ; the object is called emlRecording_DO_NOT_REMOVE: a name is the only
    ; warning that can reach a user who is about to remove it.
    ;
    ; `nocheck selectObject:` by name leaves nothing selected and raises no
    ; error when the object is absent, which is exactly the test wanted.
    ; Measured on 6.6.30.
    ;
    ; ONLY when this script has not already found it: a wrapper that called
    ; @emlRecordBegin in this same run must not have its id replaced.
    ; ------------------------------------------------------------------
    if emlRecordBufferId = 0

        endif
    endif

    ; ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; THE SESSION'S METADATA IS AN OBJECT TOO, FOR EXACTLY THE SAME REASON.
    ;
    ; The buffer re-attaches above and the steps survive. Everything ABOUT
    ; the session would not: emlRecordStamp$, emlRecordHeaderInput$ and its
    ; shape are ordinary script variables, so a recording made the way a user
    ; makes one -- one menu command per operation -- reaches flush with every
    ; one of them at its default. A 23-step recording then emits an empty
    ; timestamp and the header block
    ;
    ;     # NOT RECORDED. Nothing in this session named the object it
    ;     # ran on ...
    ;
    ; while the manifest three lines below it names "Table voiceA": the file
    ; contradicts itself, and a test that records in ONE scope cannot see it.
    ;
    ; So the same mechanism as the buffer: a second Table, re-attached by
    ; name, and the globals HYDRATED from it below once their defaults are in
    ; place. A field added later needs no new plumbing -- it is a row.
    ; ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; PAIRED TO THE BUFFER BY ID, NOT FOUND BY NAME.
    ;
    ; `nocheck selectObject: "Table emlRecordMeta"` is sound only while
    ; exactly one meta table exists, and two can: a user deletes the BUFFER
    ; from the Objects window mid-recording -- which silently ends the
    ; recording -- and the meta table is left behind, orphaned. The next
    ; recording creates its own pair, and two objects answer to the same
    ; name. Praat resolves that ambiguity on its own terms, and it can resolve
    ; to the DEAD one: a live session then emits a script stamped with a
    ; session thrown away minutes earlier. Every step emits correctly, so
    ; nothing looks wrong; only the provenance lies, which is the half of the
    ; file a reader trusts most.
    ;
    ; So the meta is not asked for by name at all. @emlRecordBegin writes the
    ; buffer's own id into the meta under "buffer", so the pair is stated
    ; rather than inferred, and the search below accepts only the meta whose
    ; stated buffer IS the live buffer. A meta that names no buffer, or names
    ; a dead one, is an orphan and is left alone -- hydrating from it is
    ; exactly the defect.
    ;
    ; NO BUFFER MEANS NO META. Before a recording starts, and after one is
    ; discarded, emlRecordBufferId is 0 and nothing can match -- which is
    ; correct, and is what keeps a stale meta from furnishing a session that
    ; has not begun.
    ;
    ; THE SELECTION IS PUT BACK. `select all` is how a name is enumerated in
    ; Praat, and this procedure is called at the top of thirteen orchestrators
    ; and sixteen draw procedures, several of which have a live selection at
    ; that moment. A one-line re-attach disturbs it too -- and the
    ; wider sweep here would disturb it differently, which is the kind of
    ; change that shows up two files away.

# THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THE FOLDER NAME IS WRITTEN. Praat gives a script no

# meant for somebody else has to be written. Result in emlPluginRoot.root$.
#
# THE INSTALL DIRECTORY ITSELF is emlPluginRoot.abs$ -- preferencesDirectory$
# joined to the folder name, which is the path to read a shipped file out of
# on THIS machine. Everything in the plugin that opens one of its own files
# takes that answer from here, so the join happens once and a caller cannot
# spell the folder differently from the resolver.
#
# TWO CALLERS, ONE PROCEDURE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. @emlRecordBegin resolves
# the root for the include block it emits into a recorded script; setup.praat
# resolves it to generate scripts/eml-lib-user.praat. Two copies of this
# arithmetic would be two things that can disagree about where the plugin is,
# and a user whose generated barrel and whose recorded script disagree has no
# way to tell which one is lying.
#
# IT LIVES IN THIS FILE BECAUSE OF HOW `include` RESOLVES A RELATIVE PATH.
# Measured on 6.6.30: a relative include inside an included file resolves
# against the TOP-LEVEL script's folder, not against the folder of the file
# the line is written in. eml-record.praat is included from plugin/scripts/
# wrappers, from setup.praat at the plugin root, and from emitted user scripts
# in folders this project never sees, so it can carry no relative include of
# its own -- a shared file it pointed at would resolve differently for each of
# those three, and `include` takes a literal, so the path cannot be computed.
# A procedure defined HERE reaches every one of them for free.
#
# ALWAYS HOME-RELATIVE.
#
# What it resolves is a USER artefact's path. Where the plugin happens to sit
# on one machine is an accident of that machine, and a path that hard-codes it
# is worth nothing to the person the file is for. Praat's preferences
# directory lives under the user's home on every supported platform, and
# `include` accepts a leading ~ -- tested on a path containing spaces
# (macOS's "Praat Prefs") under both 6.4.06 and 7.0. That one substitution
# takes an emitted file from one-machine to any-user-on-this-platform.
#
# The only way the substitution can fail is a preferences directory outside
# $HOME, which Praat produces only under an explicit --pref-dir. That is a
# test rig, not a configuration: this repository's own harnesses use it.
# Returning an absolute path in that case would write the RIG's geometry into
# a file meant for a user, so the fallback is the canonical location for the
# running platform and version -- the same four paths a recorded script's
# header lists -- and the answer stays portable.

    ; file. Every acoustic figure recorded from the menu would emit a script
    ; that cannot run, instructing the reader to open a deleted object.

#
# So this takes the four strings that are genuinely per-analysis and does

# Results are added by the caller afterwards with @emlRecordResult where the

# guard in an orchestrator jumps there, so an analysis that refused -- too few
# groups, a non-numeric column -- is recorded as a step carrying its refusal
# rather than vanishing. A log that shows only the analyses that succeeded
# lies by omission, and the one it hides is usually the one worth reading.

# WHY THIS EXISTS. Four of the plugin's figures are drawn from objects the
# user does not have to make. Select a Sound and ask for an F0 contour, a
# spectrum or an LTAS and @emlGraphsWorkflow converts it, draws, and REMOVES
# the intermediate at the end of the pass. That is the documented behaviour
# and it is the behaviour most users will meet, since a Sound is what comes
# off a recorder.
#
# The recorder's capture hook is inside the DRAW procedure, so what it sees
# is the intermediate: without this step, an acoustic figure recorded from
# the menu writes `data1$ = "Pitch tone"` into the manifest and tells the
# reader to have that object open -- an object the plugin deleted moments
# earlier and the user never made. Such a script cannot run.
#
# Recording the conversion fixes both halves at once: the manifest names the
# SOUND, which is the thing the user actually selected and still has, and the
# emitted file carries the command that turns it into what the figure needs.
# The reader can also SEE the conversion, with its parameters, which is worth
# more than the figure line on its own -- the pitch floor and ceiling used
# are a methods-section fact.

#   .sourceId   the object the user selected (the Sound)

# THE SETTINGS THAT ARE NOT ARGUMENTS.
#
# `Show jittered points` is not a parameter of @emlDrawViolinPlot. It is a
# GLOBAL -- prev_violinShowJitter -- set by the graphs form and read by the
# draw procedure through variableExists. A recorded call that carries every
# argument faithfully therefore still replays a different figure: record an
# advanced-mode violin with jitter ticked, stop, save, replay, and the violin
# comes back while the points do not, a difference of ~2400 dark pixels on a
# 2-group violin.
#
# THE SAME SHAPE IS IN THE DRAW LAYER: the scatter recorder in
# eml-draw-procedures.praat prepends `scatterAnalysisType = ...` and two
# siblings to its own code line, and validate/v39 pins that it does. Four more
# draw procedures have the same shape. Writing the block five more times in
# the draw layer is how a recorder drifts away from the figures it records --
# the argument @emlRecordDrawStep's own header makes -- so it is done ONCE,
# here, for every step.
#
# WHY IT CAN ONLY BE DONE HERE. These globals belong to the FORM's scope. The
# flush is a different menu command in a different scope, where none of them
# exist. @emlRecordStep is the last moment they are readable, so it is the
# only moment they can be recorded.
#
# EVERY GLOBAL PRESENT IS EMITTED, INCLUDING THE ZEROES, and that is not
# tidiness. An emitted script is one scope: a figure drawn with jitter on
# leaves prev_violinShowJitter = 1 behind, and a later figure in the same
# script that was drawn WITHOUT it would inherit the 1 and gain points the
# user never asked for. A step is only self-contained if it states the
# settings it did not use.
#
# READ THROUGH variableExists, ALWAYS. A direct caller -- a user script, a
# PraatGen companion, this tree's own harnesses -- sets none of these, and
# reading one unconditionally is what kills the
# harness with "Unknown variable".

#
# THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME PROBLEM: THE BRACKET.
#
# The recorded script for an annotated violin already contains both halves of
# the annotation: the bridge step that runs the test and fills annotBracketN,
# annotBracketLabel$[] and the rest, and the draw step that draws the violin.
# Neither of them draws the bracket. It is drawn by
# @emlGraphsPostDispatchAnnotations in eml-graphs-form.praat, AFTER the draw
# procedure returns, and the emitted file cannot call it: including
# eml-graphs-form.praat would run the graphs form. So without this, a recorded
# annotated figure is structurally incapable of coming back annotated -- the
# recorder carries the inputs to a step it never carries.
#
# So the render is emitted, from here, as the step's own tail. The values it
# needs that belong to the form -- the data maximum the brackets sit above,
# which figure was drawn -- are captured as literals at record time; the
# values that belong to the FIGURE are referenced through the draw
# procedure's own axis accessors, so a script re-pointed at other data
# re-resolves them rather than pinning last month's axis.
#
# THE MATRIX PANEL IS NOT REPLAYED, AND THE FILE SAYS SO. With four or more
# groups (or a grouped violin or grouped box plot) the annotation is a
# comparison-matrix panel drawn BELOW the figure, on a canvas the graphs form
# enlarges around the draw. The recorded step carries the draw, not the
# canvas, so emitting the panel call would place it outside the picture that
# gets saved. An honest comment is worth more than a silently misplaced
# panel: the emitted file names what it did not reproduce.
#
# WHY .kind$ IS TAKEN AND CHECKED. Only a draw step has a figure to annotate.
# The bridge step that computed the statistics is an "analysis" step and must
# emit nothing here, or the annotation would be rendered before the figure it

# @emlRecordNewRun
# THE NEXT STEP RECORDED BEGINS A NEW RUN.
#
# A RUN IS ONE PASS THROUGH A GUI FORM AND THE SAVE THAT BELONGS TO IT, and
# the editable block at the top of an emitted script names every variable it
# lifts by the run it came from: run 2's grouping column is groupCol2$, and it
# is groupCol2$ whether or not run 1 had a grouping column and whether or not
# the two happen to name the same column. Run 2 has no knowledge of run 1, so
# an edit to one moves one figure.
#
# WHY A CALL AND NOT A DEDUCTION. Half of the boundary is free: a new menu
# command is a new script scope, emlRecordRun is absent there, and the first
# step claims a fresh number without anybody saying so. The other half cannot
# be deduced at all. A wrapper's `New` button and the graphs form's `Redraw`
# both stay INSIDE one script scope and both are new runs -- same variables,
# same objects, a second complete pass through the form -- and nothing in the
# buffer distinguishes that from the two steps ONE pass records when it
# annotates a figure with its own statistics. Reading it off the step kinds
# would name that pair two runs and split a figure from the numbers drawn on
# it; reading it off step parity would do worse. So the form that knows says
# so, once, at the top of the pass.
#
# IT RELEASES, IT DOES NOT ALLOCATE. Nothing is written and no number is
# taken: a pass the user cancels records no step, and a run number spent on
# it would make the block's numbering and the user's presses disagree from
# there on.
#
# AND IT DOES NOT CALL @emlRecordInit, WHICH IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. That
# procedure re-attaches to the buffer by name, and `nocheck selectObject:` on
# a name is how a Praat script enumerates one -- so it MOVES THE OBJECTS-
# WINDOW SELECTION. The callers are the graphs form and the wrappers at the
# top of a pass, where the selection is the user's choice of what to work on
# and is read a few lines later: calling init here answered a form with "No
# Table selected" for a Table the user had selected. Measured on 6.6.30, on
# harness/axisrefuse, which drives that dialog. Nothing here needs init:
# assigning a global creates it, and @emlRecordStep calls init before it
# reads this.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlRecordMark / @emlRecordRewind
# REMEMBER HOW MANY STEPS THERE WERE, AND GO BACK TO IT. For a caller that
# performs an operation it then throws away.
#
# ONE USER ACTION EMITS ONE DRAW STEP. The pair below is the recorder's half
# of that; the caller's half is two lines in @emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom,
# which draws a figure whose legend would sit on the data, MEASURES it, and
# draws it again on a widened axis, throwing the first pass away. Both passes
# reach the recorder, so without a mark and a rewind one press of Draw emits
#
#     # --- Step 1 (draw) ---   ... @emlDrawGroupedViolin: ... axisYMin, axisYMax
#     # --- Step 2 (draw) ---   ... @emlDrawGroupedViolin: ... axisYMin, axisYMax
#
# -- the same figure twice, with the block reading `steps 1 (draw), 2 (draw)`.
# Worse than the duplication: the block's resolved-range note quotes the FIRST
# step to use a pair (see @emlRecordColumnManifest), so it would name the axis
# of the pass that was discarded rather than the figure on the user's screen
# -- the one number the block gives a reader who wants their frame back,
# naming a picture nobody ever saw. harness/formaxis's legend_auto leg is the
# drive.
#
# THE SAME SHAPE AS @emlCSVMark / @emlCSVRewind IN stats/eml-output.praat,
# deliberately, and for the same reason: rows that have not been written out
# yet can simply be rewound, and an operation that was never on the page has
# no business in the record.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. This is not an undo, and it is not addressed to legends. It
# knows nothing about graphs, passes or axes: it remembers a row count and a
# step counter and puts them back, so the NEXT two-pass caller -- a bracket
# stack that has to be measured before it is drawn, a matrix panel that lays
# itself out twice -- can use it without this file learning what it is for.
#
# NOT A STACK, for @emlCSVMark's reason: one mark, because the one caller has
# one nesting level, and a stack nobody pops is a leak with extra steps.
#
# WHAT IS RESTORED, and why each one:
#   · the buffer's rows. Removed from the END backwards, because Praat
#     renumbers rows on removal and walking forwards would skip every second
#     one -- and down to ZERO rows by replacing the object, because Praat
#     refuses to remove a Table's only row and `nocheck` in front of that
#     refusal is a skip, not a suppression. See the block itself; a mark of
#     zero rows is the ORDINARY case, since most figures are drawn without an
#     analysis before them.
#   · emlRecordN, which is what the renderer NUMBERS STEPS FROM -- it goes
#     into the row's `n` column, and both the step headings and the block's
#     step list are printed from it. Without the restore the counter keeps
#     climbing across a discarded pass, and a recording whose only step is a
#     legend figure emits "# --- Step 2 (draw) ---" with a block reading
#     "step 2 (draw)"; put an analysis in front of it and the figure becomes
#     step 3 of two. Measured by breaking exactly this line --
#     harness/record/replay_break.sh's rows_only leg.
#
#     WHAT THE COUNTER DOES *NOT* BREAK, because it was checked rather than
#     assumed: the axis stamp. @emlGraphsStampAxisRequest writes emlRecordN + 1
#     and @emlRecordAxisRequest compares against emlRecordN + 1, so both sides
#     read the same counter and a counter left one too high is still
#     self-consistent -- the rows_only tree still emits the user's own 0.0 /
#     0.0. The axis request survives a broken restore here; the numbering does
#     not.
#   · emlRecordCurrentSource$ and emlRecordStepDerived$, the two script-scope
#     variables @emlRecordSource writes and @emlRecordStep reads. The renderer
#     emits a select where the source CHANGES, so leaving a discarded pass's
#     value behind would suppress the select on the step that replaces it.
#
# WHAT IS NOT REWOUND, AND THAT IS A DECISION. The crash mirror
# (emlRecordTempPath$) is append-only -- it exists so that a session lost to a
# crash survives as a file, which is precisely the property that makes it
# unwritable backwards. So the discard is LABELLED there instead, the same rule
# @emlGraphsDrawWithLegendRoom follows for the Info window: say what happened
# rather than hide it. Nothing reads the mirror to rebuild a recording; it is
# read by a human after a crash, and a human is better served by "these two
# steps were thrown away" than by a file that quietly disagrees with the
# buffer.
#
# THE SELECTION IS PUT BACK, BOTH TIMES. @emlRecordInit re-attaches by name
# with `nocheck selectObject:`, which leaves NOTHING selected when no recording
# exists, and both procedures below then select the buffer to count or trim it.
# They are called from the middle of a draw flow, between one draw and the
# next, where the caller's object selection is live -- @emlGraphsStampAxisRequest
# restores objectId for exactly this reason. Snapshot is taken before
# @emlRecordInit, not after, because the re-attach is the first thing that
# disturbs it.
#
# Outputs: emlRecordMark_have  1 if a mark is live, 0 if there is nothing to
#                              go back to (no recording, or Rewind before Mark)

# @emlRecordAxisRequest: .fbMin, .fbMax
# WHAT THE USER ASKED FOR, WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT THE DRAW WAS GIVEN.
#
# THE CONTRACT. The editable top block notes whether the range was AUTO and
# offers 0.0 to 0.0 for it, and the recorded CALL carries the same choice --
# (0, 0) is the sentinel the dialog names on its own face, not a range. This
# procedure is the half of that which makes the choice recoverable at the
# moment the recorder runs.
#
# ON TWO PATHS IT IS NOT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS PROCEDURE EXISTS.
# graphs/eml-graphs-form.praat converts auto into explicit BEFORE the draw
# that gets recorded:
#
#   * the bracket-headroom pass, which widens the axis to fit an annotation
#     bracket and writes the widened numbers back into valueMin/valueMax;
#   * the legend-room second pass, which does the same for a legend and then
#     DRAWS AGAIN on the widened axis -- so the recorder's .vMin/.vMax on an
#     annotated or legend-bearing figure are the resolved numbers, and the
#     user's "auto" is already gone by the time this file can see it.
#
# So the form publishes the untouched request as two globals, set where the
# user's values are first read and not written by either pass:
#
#     emlGraphsAxisYReqMin , emlGraphsAxisYReqMax
#
# and every recorder prefers them. THE FALLBACK IS NOT A COURTESY. Nothing
# outside the graphs form sets those globals -- the API-export path, the batch
# module, harness drivers and any user script calling a draw procedure
# directly all reach the recorder without a form ever having run -- and for
# every one of them the argument the draw was given IS the user's request.
# Preferring a global that does not exist would be an abort; requiring one
# would make the recorder depend on a dialog it must work without.
#
# BOTH OR NEITHER. The pair is read as a pair: a caller that published only
# one of the two would otherwise get a min from the form and a max from the
# draw, which is a range nobody asked for and the (0, 0) auto sentinel cannot
# survive. If either global is missing, both arguments are used.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE STEP STAMP, AND WHY EXISTENCE IS NOT ENOUGH.
#
# PRAAT CANNOT UNSET A VARIABLE. So a version of this procedure that preferred
# the pair whenever it EXISTED would prefer it for the whole life of the
# process: one press of Draw on the graphs form publishes a range, and every
# recorded draw after it -- in any other menu command, from any other file --
# would inherit that range as though the user had just typed it. "Some form
# ran earlier this session" and "this draw came from the form" are the same
# two doubles, so nothing would raise.
#
# WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. graphs/eml-draw-qq.praat calls
# @emlDrawScatterPlot with 0, 0, 0, 0 -- its own auto sentinel, and it has no
# form and no dialog of its own. Draw a violin on 0..100 from EML Graphs, then
# ask the Q-Q plot for a figure in the same session with a recording running,
# and the Q-Q step would come out declaring axisYMin = 0.0 / axisYMax = 100.0.
# The fallback below is right for that call; what is needed is for it to be
# REACHED.
#
# THE MECHANISM: a third global, published with the pair and reset here.
#
#     emlGraphsAxisYReqStep
#
# It holds the STEP NUMBER the publication was made for. This procedure runs
# before @emlRecordStep, which increments emlRecordN and then appends, so the
# row about to be written is emlRecordN + 1; the pair is preferred only when
# the stamp equals that number, and the stamp is reassigned to 0 immediately
# afterwards.
#
# THE STAMP IS WHAT MAKES THIS WORK, AND IT IS WORTH SAYING WHY IT CANNOT BE
# SIMPLIFIED AWAY INTO THE PAIR. The pair cannot be reset: 0 and 0 IS the auto
# sentinel, the value a user gets by leaving the dialog alone, so "clear the
# published range after use" and "publish an auto range" are the same two
# doubles and the reader cannot tell them apart. The stamp has no such
# collision -- step numbers start at 1, so 0 means CONSUMED and nothing else --
# which is why the consume-once state lives in a variable Praat can overwrite
# with a value that means nothing rather than in one it cannot unset.
#
# THE STAMP IS RESET WHETHER OR NOT IT MATCHED. A stamp that did not match is
# a publication that has outlived its press; leaving it armed would let it
# match some later step by arithmetic coincidence. There is no reading under
# which a stale stamp becomes valid again.
#
# BOTH OR NEITHER APPLIES TO THE STAMP TOO. A pair published with no stamp is
# treated as ABSENT -- the arguments win -- because an unstamped pair is
# exactly the publication that outlives its press. That is asserted, not
# assumed: validate/v74 drives a leg that publishes the pair and no stamp and
# requires the draw's own range to survive.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlRecordColumnSpec: .proc$
# WHICH ARGUMENTS OF WHICH PROCEDURE ARE COLUMN NAMES, AND WHAT EACH IS FOR.
#
# THE RETARGET BLOCK GATHERS COLUMN NAMES AS WELL AS OBJECT NAMES, because
# the block's promise is "edit a name to run the same workflow on other data".
# Column names hard-coded at the call sites --
#
#     @emlBridgeGroupComparison: data, "val", "grp", 0.05, ...
#
# -- would mean hunting literals through the steps to re-point a recorded
# workflow at a same-shape table with different headers, which is the exact
# hunt the block exists to abolish. Nothing below the block names an object
# AND nothing below it names a column.
#
# WHY THE MAP LIVES HERE AND NOT AT THE CALL SITES. The obvious design is for
# each orchestrator to hand the recorder its column names with their roles
# attached. It is also the wrong one for this plugin: there are twenty-six
# emitting call sites across three files, the recorder owns what the emitted
# file SAYS (the save-step rewrite in @emlRecordRender is settled on the same
# ground), and a per-site change would put the same decision in twenty-six
# places for twenty-six people to get subtly different. One table, one place.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY: this table is hand-maintained against
# signatures it does not own. An orchestrator that reorders its arguments
# without editing here would have its columns lifted from the wrong slots. That
# is not caught by reading -- it is caught by RUNNING, which is why v58's
# retarget leg edits the block and drives the emitted file rather than grepping
# it. A wrong index produces a script that either aborts or analyses the wrong
# column, and both are red there.
#
# THE ARGUMENT INDEX COUNTS THE OBJECT. Every emitted call is
# `@proc: data, ...`, so `data` is argument 1 and the first column of a stats
# orchestrator is argument 2. The draw procedures all share the same preamble
# -- data, title, xLabel, yLabel, width, height, colorMode, gridMode -- so
# their columns begin at argument 9.
#
# LABELS ARE NOT COLUMNS, and the difference is the whole of the role rule. A
# violin's yLabel is very often the same STRING as its value column, because
# the form defaults it that way; it is still text drawn on a figure and not a
# column reference, so it is left where the user typed it.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE NUMERIC SLOTS, WHICH ARE THE SECOND TABLE IN THIS PROCEDURE.
#
# The block's promise -- nothing below it names an object and nothing below it
# names a column -- extends to the axis: nothing below it holds an axis range
# either. So the axis pair is lifted exactly the way a column is, into
# `axisYMin` and `axisYMax`, and the step reads them.
#
# THE UNIT IS THE PAIR AND NOT THE NUMBER, which is a fact about the axis
# rather than about the naming. The auto sentinel is (0, 0): a lone 0 in the
# minimum slot is a perfectly ordinary axis FLOOR -- a bar chart's is zero --
# and it means nothing on its own. So the two slots are read together, matched
# together and declared together, and a range is lifted only when BOTH slots
# parse as plain numbers: a half-lifted range would let the block move one end
# of an axis and not the other.
#
# WHICH RUN THE PAIR BELONGS TO IS WHAT NAMES IT, exactly as it names every
# other variable in the block -- run 1's is axisYMin/axisYMax and run 2's is
# axisYMin2/axisYMax2, so each figure's note can quote the range that figure
# came out at. See @emlRecordColumnManifest.
#
# THE ROLE NAME TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT WHICH AXIS IT IS. Twelve of the thirteen
# draw procedures take the dialog's range as their Y axis and get axisY*. The
# HISTOGRAM does not: its dialog says "Value maximum / Value minimum" and
# those bound the axis it draws HORIZONTALLY -- its vertical axis is a count,
# bounded by a single frequency maximum over a hard floor of zero, which is
# not a pair and has no (0, 0) sentinel. Calling that pair axisYMin would put
# a variable named for one axis in charge of the other, which is the kind of
# thing this block exists to abolish; it is axisValue* instead.
#
# WHY THE KEY IS `.axisProc$` AND NOT `.proc$`, WHICH IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE.
# validate/v58 §8 censuses this file's column map by reading every line
# spelled `if .proc$ = "..."` and requiring each name it finds to be a
# procedure whose recorded call template interpolates a COLUMN variable. Four
# of the draw procedures below -- waveform, spectrum, LTAS and F0 contour --
# draw an object whole and name no column at all; they are correctly outside
# that census and adding them to it would report them as dead entries. Two
# tables, two keys, two censuses: v58 owns the column one and validate/v67
# owns this one, in both directions, for the same reason v58 gives -- a
# hand-maintained map that falls behind the signatures it does not own lifts
# nothing and says nothing.

# Is this argument a plain string literal, and if so what does it say?

# THE GUARD IS THE POINT, not the extraction. An argument is only rewritten
# when it is unambiguously one literal: exactly two quote characters, first and
# last. A title carrying an escaped quote makes the quote-depth walk above
# ambiguous, and the honest response to an ambiguous parse in a file that has
# to RUN is to leave the line exactly as it was recorded. A literal left
# un-lifted is a blemish; a mangled call is a broken script.
#
# THE NUMERIC PATH IS THE SAME GUARD APPLIED TO A DIFFERENT SHAPE. An axis argument is only lifted when it is unambiguously
# one number: an optional sign, digits, at most one decimal point, nothing
# else. Anything that is not -- a variable name, an arithmetic expression, a
# procedure result, an already-lifted `axisYMin` from a re-recorded session --
# is left exactly where it was recorded, for the reason above: a literal left
# un-lifted is a blemish and a mangled call is a broken script. Praat has no
# regex, so this is a character walk like everything else here.
#
# AND AN EMPTY-STRING TEST IS NOT A ZERO TEST, which is the trap this half has
# to avoid. The column path skips a literal that is "" because a role the
# session did not use has no business in the block. The axis path must NOT
# skip a literal that is 0: (0, 0) is precisely the value the block exists to

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# @emlRecordColumnManifest
# The column half of the retarget block, and the rewritten steps that read it.
#
# ONE VARIABLE PER ROLE PER RUN, AND THE SUFFIX IS THE RUN NUMBER.
#
# A RUN is one pass through a GUI form and the save that belongs to it -- see
# @emlRecordNewRun, which is what draws the boundary. Run 1's variables are
# unsuffixed, run 2's end in 2, run 3's in 3:
#
#     run 1   valueCol$    groupCol$    axisYMin    figureFormat$
#     run 2   valueCol2$   groupCol2$   axisYMin2   figureFormat2$
#
# and that is the whole of the naming rule. It holds for every variable the
# block lifts -- columns, the axis pair, the figure format -- with no field
# deciding anything for itself.
#
# WHAT FOLLOWS FROM IT, and every one of these is the point rather than a
# side effect:
#
#   * A ROLE THAT ONLY RUN 2 USED IS STILL SUFFIXED 2. The suffix says which
#     pass the variable belongs to, not how many variables of that role came
#     before it, so a scatter's grouping column in run 2 is groupCol2$ even
#     when run 1 was a box plot that had no grouping column at all.
#   * TWO RUNS THAT NAME THE SAME COLUMN GET TWO VARIABLES. Two runs of the
#     same figure on two tables, both of which call their count column "n",
#     are two decisions the user made twice; one variable governing both
#     would mean editing run 2 silently redrew run 1.
#   * TWO RUNS ON ONE TABLE GET data1$ AND data2$, both reading the same name,
#     because retargeting the second run is what the block is for.
#   * The AXIS PAIR and the FIGURE FORMAT follow it exactly. A run's resolved
#     -axis note quotes THAT run's numbers, and a session that saved run 1 as
#     PNG and run 2 as PDF comes back with both.
#
# NO VALUE IS COMPARED TO CHOOSE A NAME. Two slots of one role in one run are
# one variable because they are one pass through one form, not because they
# read alike; two slots in two runs are two variables even when they read
# identically. The only place a literal is looked at is the one below.
#
# THE ONE PLACE A RUN CANNOT SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE. A user may press Save twice
# in one pass and tick different formats -- the post-draw dialog stays open --
# and one variable cannot hold two answers. So a second slot of a role within
# one run that carries a DIFFERENT literal is given the run number and a
# letter, figureFormat2b$, which says what it is: run 2's second answer. The
# alternative is a variable that silently replays one save's choice into the
# other, and lettering it is the only part of this that reads a literal at
# all.
#
# THE REWRITE IS POSITIONAL, NEVER textual. Replacing the string "val"
# throughout a step would also replace the axis label that happens to read
# "val", which is not a column and must not follow the data. Each call is
# split into arguments, the arguments named by the spec are replaced, and the
# line is rejoined. Everything else in the line is untouched by construction.
#
# THE AXIS IS LIFTED AS A PAIR, which is a fact about the axis and not about
# the naming. See @emlRecordColumnSpec's header: a lone 0 in a minimum slot is
# an ordinary axis floor, the (0, 0) that means AUTO is a property of the two
# together, and both slots must parse as numbers or neither moves.
#
# AND ZERO IS NOT ABSENT. The column path skips a literal of "" because a role
# the session did not use has no business in the block; the axis path lifts a
# literal of 0 precisely because that is the auto sentinel it must preserve.
# The format path skips an empty literal for the column path's reason -- an
# empty format choice is a save that wrote no figure, and a variable for a
# format nothing writes invites an edit that does nothing.
#
# A BUFFER FROM BEFORE THE `run` COLUMN EXISTED still emits. A user recording
# while the plugin is upgraded re-attaches to one, and its steps carry no run;
# each such step is read as its own run, which over-separates rather than
# sharing a variable between passes that never agreed to share one.

# WHY A BLOCK RATHER THAN A SELECT PER STEP. Both produce a script that runs.
# Only one of them can be EDITED: re-pointing a recorded workflow at another
# data set is the main thing anybody will want to do with the file, and that
# has to be one visible place near the top rather than a hunt through the body
# for every mention of an object.
#
# So each distinct source becomes `tableN$ = "name"` with an inline note of
# the steps that used it, and the body refers to tableN$ and never to a name.
# Change the string, run it again on other data.
#
# ONE SOURCE MEANS NO BLOCK. A session that never moved keeps the contract it
# has always had -- select the Table, run the file -- and emits nothing here.
# The block exists to answer a question a single-source session does not ask.
#
# Outputs: .out$   the block, empty when fewer than two sources were used

    ; ONE EDITABLE BLOCK. HOME-RELATIVE, NOT MACHINE-ABSOLUTE.
    ;
    ; `include` takes a LITERAL path -- no variable, no form field. But it
    ; DOES accept a leading `~`, tested on a path containing
    ; spaces (macOS's "Praat Prefs") under both 6.4.06 and 7.0. So the block
    ; below is portable across every user on this platform, and only the
    ; middle segment is platform- and version-specific.
    ;
    ; A CONDITIONAL INCLUDE WOULD SOLVE THE REST, AND DOES NOT WORK.
    ; Wrapping the two spellings in `if praatVersion >= 7000 ... else ...`
    ; looks like it works: a FALSE branch's include is skipped and the script
    ; runs to the end. That is a false positive -- nothing ran. Put the
    ; include in the TRUE branch and Praat refuses it:
    ;
    ;     Script line 4 not performed or completed:
    ;     « include ~/... »
    ;
    ; So the file carries the spelling for the version that recorded it and
    ; NAMES the others, because a failed parse cannot be caught by a guard --
    ; the guard would never run.
    ;
    ; THE FOLDER MOVED IN PRAAT 7. Measured on this machine:
    ;     6.6.30  ->  ~/.praat-dir
    ;     7.0     ->  ~/.config/praat
    ; which is why the version that recorded the session is stated above and
    ; the known locations are listed below.
    ;
    ; AND THE CLAIM IS UNCONDITIONAL, BECAUSE IT IS TRUE BY CONSTRUCTION.
    ;
    ; The sentence below says "Paths are home-relative, so they work for any
    ; user on this platform", and it is not conditional on anything.
    ; @emlRecordBegin guarantees a tilde: it rewrites the resolved root
    ; home-relative and falls back to the platform's canonical location when
    ; the live preferences directory is outside $HOME -- which happens only
    ; under an explicit --pref-dir, i.e. in a test rig, never on a user's
    ; machine -- and stores the result in the meta object so it survives to
    ; the flush, which runs in a different scope. So there is no second arm to
    ; write. validate/v58 pins the tilde at the source AND in every emitted
    ; file, so the two cannot drift apart.

# @emlRecordMakeFolder: .path$
#
# createFolder: IS mkdir, NOT mkdir -p, and the difference cost a session.
#
# Measured on 6.6.30: `createFolder: "/tmp/x/a/b/c"` with none of
# a, b, c present creates NOTHING and raises an error -- it does not walk the
# path. Every caller in this plugin that types a folder into a dialog can be
# handed a path two levels deep that does not exist yet, because typing one is
# the natural thing to do when you want this study's outputs in their own
# folder.
#
# So the ancestors are created explicitly, left to right, and every step is
# `nocheck`: an ancestor that cannot be made (a drive root, a path element
# that is really a file) is not by itself a failure, and neither is the leaf,
# because this procedure does not get to decide. It is BEST EFFORT, and both
# callers follow it with a real write probe -- the only test that answers the
# question that actually matters, which is not "does this folder exist" but
# "can this folder be written to".
#
# AND `nocheck` CANNOT BE USED ON THE CALL. Measured on 6.6.30:
# `nocheck @someProcedure: arg` does not run the procedure at ALL -- it is not
# an error suppressor there, it is a SKIP. Wrapping this procedure that way to
# keep a bad path from aborting a caller means no folder is ever created and
# the write probe below refuses every save. So the suppression lives INSIDE,
# per command, and the callers call it plainly.

# @emlRecordReplaySave: .offerFigure, .stem$, .folder$, .formats$
#
# THE NON-INTERACTIVE TWIN OF @emlSavePanel. A replayed recording must not
# reopen any dialog: it just outputs the output. That is the SPSS model
# (dialogs author syntax; running syntax is headless), and Stata do-files,
# R scripts and Praat's own paradigm.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, stated because it is a real cost: a replayed save writes
# wherever the recording was made. The folder and the
# base name are literals in the emitted file, on their own line, editable --
# and a user who wants somewhere else edits that line or runs the workflow
# fresh. The alternative is the panel reopening, which is what made a recorded
# workflow unrunnable unattended.
#
# THE TIMESTAMP IS REGENERATED, NOT REPLAYED. A recorded stem carries the
# stamp of the session that recorded it; replaying it would either overwrite
# that session's outputs or append a second stamp to the first, growing the
# name by sixteen characters per replay generation. Stripping the recorded
# stamp and taking a fresh one makes a replay's outputs the replay's, dated
# when they were made, and the name cannot accrete at all.
#
# THE COLLISION RULE IS THE PANEL'S, NOT THE RECORDER'S. One stamp per press,
# shared by every file the press writes, and the STEM is uniqued -- never the
# individual files -- against every name this call could write. The reason is
# in @emlSavePanel: three independent collision behaviours in one save give
# <stem>_1.png beside <stem>_1_tidy.csv beside an overwritten
# <stem>_report.txt.
#
# 300 dpi, because the panel's DPI switch is a dialog field and there is no
# dialog. It is the panel's own default and the figure is redrawable at any
# resolution by re-running the step above.
#
# THE FIGURE IS WRITTEN BY THE PANEL'S OWN WRITER, @eml_saveFigureFormats,
# and not by a `Save as ... file:` line of this procedure's own. Two
# implementations of one job is the defect this project has repaired three
# times: they agree on the day they are written and drift afterwards, and the
# drift here would be silent -- a replay quietly producing a PNG where the
# session produced a PNG and an EPS. Everything the writer does comes with
# it, including the landed-file check, so a replay counts files it found
# rather than commands it issued.
#
# THE FORMAT CHOICE IS AN ARGUMENT, because it is the user's and not this
# procedure's. .formats$ is the comma-separated list the recorded session
# asked for -- "PNG", "PNG, EPS", "PNG, EPS, PDF" -- and the emitted script
# passes it from a variable declared in its own editable block, so a reader
# who wants EPS next time edits one line at the top of the file. An empty
# .formats$ means the recorded save had no figure in it.
#
# A FORMAT THAT DOES NOT ARRIVE IS STATED, NOT SWALLOWED. The panel shows the
# redirect in a dialog; a replay must not open one, so the same lines --
# built by the same procedure, so the two cannot say different things -- go
# to the Info window instead.
#
# Arguments: .offerFigure  1 when the recorded save wrote a figure
